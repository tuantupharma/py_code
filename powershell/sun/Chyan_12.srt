00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:07,703
Hello.

3
00:00:07,978 --> 00:00:11,183
Previously, we composed the thumbnail sketch.

4
00:00:11,185 --> 00:00:13,020
Today, we'll rough in the colors.

5
00:00:13,087 --> 00:00:17,204
So, I have the lines of a character.

6
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:18,375
Previously, I wanted to

7
00:00:18,376 --> 00:00:21,345
also teach you how to draw the outlines.

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:25,167
But, as I made the curriculum, I focused more on creating the atmosphere.

9
00:00:25,168 --> 00:00:26,833
So, I omitted that part.

10
00:00:26,834 --> 00:00:29,590
So, I'm just going to briefly go over

11
00:00:29,591 --> 00:00:31,768
what's important when you're drawing lines.

12
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,686
Today, I'll show you how to rough in colors.

13
00:00:34,688 --> 00:00:37,089
I'll tell you the details as I go on.

14
00:00:37,091 --> 00:00:38,397
When you rough in colors,

15
00:00:38,422 --> 00:00:42,955
instead of coloring in after you have the lines done,

16
00:00:42,956 --> 00:00:46,242
it's actually the best to rough them in

17
00:00:46,243 --> 00:00:47,319
in the rough sketch stage.

18
00:00:47,522 --> 00:00:51,276
Because, there are some things you can't see with just sketches.

19
00:00:51,277 --> 00:00:54,881
The canvas could look empty, for example, after you colored everything in.

20
00:00:54,906 --> 00:00:57,887
Or the areas with less dimensional effects

21
00:00:57,912 --> 00:01:00,282
will be more visible.

22
00:01:00,284 --> 00:01:02,596
So, before you draw the lines,

23
00:01:02,598 --> 00:01:05,709
you should check those parts, and before you move on,

24
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:08,371
you should know that it's better to rough in the colors first,

25
00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:12,702
and that because it's a practice drawing,

26
00:01:12,727 --> 00:01:15,401
I drew in the lines first.

27
00:01:15,426 --> 00:01:17,429
First, I'll go over what's important

28
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,456
when you're drawing lines.

29
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:26,189
When you just have the correct lines,

30
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,593
if you're coloring it in detail,

31
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:31,278
these won't be that important.

32
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:34,460
In fact, if you color it in, you won't see the lines well.

33
00:01:35,535 --> 00:01:37,254
So, after coloring it in, the lines aren't discernible.

34
00:01:37,255 --> 00:01:38,533
The lines aren't that important.

35
00:01:38,558 --> 00:01:41,675
Does that mean they have no importance?

36
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,295
That wouldn't be the answer.

37
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,454
The cleaner the lines are,

38
00:01:46,455 --> 00:01:49,726
when you work on it later, you can minimize mistakes

39
00:01:49,727 --> 00:01:51,515
related to the form.

40
00:01:51,598 --> 00:01:52,888
There are also people

41
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:55,293
who find the outlines attractive.

42
00:01:55,318 --> 00:01:56,838
So, making the lines attractive

43
00:01:56,839 --> 00:01:58,092
and sophisticated

44
00:01:58,094 --> 00:02:01,424
is never a waste of time.

45
00:02:01,727 --> 00:02:03,397
So, how would we make this line area

46
00:02:03,398 --> 00:02:05,602
to make it more detailed?

47
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,991
There are a few parts that we focus on.

48
00:02:08,016 --> 00:02:12,524
The most important thing is

49
00:02:12,525 --> 00:02:13,669
adjusting the strengths and weaknesses.

50
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:18,444
What's the most important?

51
00:02:18,445 --> 00:02:20,113
First of all,

52
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,426
it would be where the shadows are.

53
00:02:26,795 --> 00:02:27,797
What does that mean?

54
00:02:27,798 --> 00:02:30,508
There's some distance between the hair and the skin.

55
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:32,304
So, between those areas,

56
00:02:32,305 --> 00:02:35,075
very dark shadows are formed.

57
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,474
We call these shadows

58
00:02:36,499 --> 00:02:40,387
closed light or shielded light.

59
00:02:40,412 --> 00:02:51,444
The official name is 'ambient occlusion'.

60
00:02:51,445 --> 00:02:52,944
So, what is this?

61
00:02:52,945 --> 00:02:56,633
When the distance between two objects is close to 0

62
00:02:56,782 --> 00:02:59,004
because they're so close,

63
00:02:59,005 --> 00:03:02,976
there might be areas where the light can't come in.

64
00:03:03,001 --> 00:03:06,004
Then, very dark shadows will be formed

65
00:03:06,092 --> 00:03:07,766
and this will be called an ambient occlusion.

66
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:11,171
With this part, I describe it as

67
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:13,907
the shadow that's formed in the distance

68
00:03:14,004 --> 00:03:15,322
between two objects.

69
00:03:15,323 --> 00:03:18,397
We also call it closed light.

70
00:03:18,484 --> 00:03:21,824
So, if the outlines are thick around this area,

71
00:03:22,005 --> 00:03:25,102
by controlling the strengths and the weaknesses

72
00:03:25,612 --> 00:03:28,589
the illustration would look much more

73
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,814
three-dimensional.

74
00:03:31,108 --> 00:03:32,539
That would be the first thing.

75
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:38,009
The second thing is the distance.

76
00:03:39,105 --> 00:03:41,779
When there's an object at the front and at the back,

77
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,864
you can use the thickness of a line

78
00:03:43,865 --> 00:03:45,315
to separate these objects.

79
00:03:45,469 --> 00:03:48,640
For instance, there's the hair in the front and the sea in the back.

80
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,686
To separate them,

81
00:03:50,687 --> 00:03:53,626
you can make the outline of the hair thick.

82
00:03:59,311 --> 00:04:00,853
Let's make it thick

83
00:04:00,855 --> 00:04:02,700
and compare the before and after.

84
00:04:05,163 --> 00:04:06,507
See how I made the screen small?

85
00:04:06,508 --> 00:04:07,796
You'll quickly notice that

86
00:04:07,797 --> 00:04:09,771
the hair looks like it's

87
00:04:09,772 --> 00:04:10,982
sticking out a bit.

88
00:04:13,377 --> 00:04:16,323
Similarly, you can make the character's outline thick

89
00:04:18,327 --> 00:04:20,433
to separate the background

90
00:04:20,655 --> 00:04:22,159
from the character.

91
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,186
If you're creating a cute atmosphere,

92
00:04:24,187 --> 00:04:25,830
or a casual atmosphere,

93
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:28,093
these types of lines would often be used.

94
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:31,209
They're also used in more dynamic illustrations.

95
00:04:31,594 --> 00:04:34,598
So, there's the difference between different distances.

96
00:04:34,982 --> 00:04:36,831
The third one is very ambiguous.

97
00:04:37,103 --> 00:04:40,042
The third one is related to the strength,

98
00:04:40,116 --> 00:04:41,584
but what is it?

99
00:04:41,609 --> 00:04:43,608
It really is ambiguous.

100
00:04:43,623 --> 00:04:45,566
From now on,

101
00:04:46,545 --> 00:04:48,357
these elements

102
00:04:48,358 --> 00:04:50,656
are related to applying deformers.

103
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:53,418
The brightness and shadows are more like a theory.

104
00:04:53,798 --> 00:04:55,444
So, what's this strength?

105
00:04:55,469 --> 00:04:57,779
You might have seen some scenes,

106
00:04:57,781 --> 00:04:59,439
in animations or comics,

107
00:04:59,464 --> 00:05:01,308
if the character swings their sword forward like this,

108
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,213
the front line becomes thicker than the back line.

109
00:05:04,543 --> 00:05:06,873
Or, if they show their fist,

110
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,265
the front line becomes thick like this

111
00:05:09,385 --> 00:05:11,113
and they would hit something with their fist.

112
00:05:11,267 --> 00:05:15,292
Likewise, you can draw a bold line for places where the strength is applied.

113
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:18,973
You can draw a thin line for the opposite.

114
00:05:18,974 --> 00:05:20,531
That way, you can show the force lines.

115
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,701
For example, at this shoulder part,

116
00:05:22,702 --> 00:05:24,764
I cut off this part

117
00:05:24,765 --> 00:05:28,026
to show these.

118
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:30,650
Or, for characters with big breasts,

119
00:05:30,675 --> 00:05:32,744
we can emphasize the breasts

120
00:05:32,891 --> 00:05:34,911
by cutting the line in the middle once.

121
00:05:36,115 --> 00:05:37,405
If you cut it like this,

122
00:05:38,396 --> 00:05:41,277
people think that there are two lines

123
00:05:41,278 --> 00:05:42,990
that go outwards,

124
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,912
so it gives the impression that the breasts are bigger.

125
00:05:48,091 --> 00:05:51,722
That's how the line that we're thinking about

126
00:05:51,724 --> 00:05:53,120
is recognized in this way.

127
00:05:53,398 --> 00:05:56,289
So it makes you think that it looks a bit bigger.

128
00:05:57,248 --> 00:06:00,851
In that way, strength control can now be applied to the area

129
00:06:00,851 --> 00:06:02,721
where the force is applied or the force is lost.

130
00:06:02,722 --> 00:06:04,646
So, you can use these

131
00:06:04,647 --> 00:06:06,396
to draw a line that's charming,

132
00:06:06,421 --> 00:06:08,927
so I think it'll be better to be aware of those things

133
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,129
when you draw the line.

134
00:06:10,516 --> 00:06:14,534
I didn't put too much into drawing the lines

135
00:06:14,565 --> 00:06:16,934
because today's lecture is all about coloring.

136
00:06:17,385 --> 00:06:19,784
But there's a certain amount of force control.

137
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:23,304
I'm going to color it now, but

138
00:06:23,306 --> 00:06:27,083
there are steps to coloring.

139
00:06:28,017 --> 00:06:29,751
I'll explain it as the steps to coloring

140
00:06:29,752 --> 00:06:32,605
instead of steps to copy coloring.

141
00:06:34,326 --> 00:06:36,493
I'll turn this off for a second.

142
00:06:42,609 --> 00:06:43,723
The steps to coloring.

143
00:06:47,275 --> 00:06:50,622
I'm going to apply the base color first.

144
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:55,819
I'll apply any color

145
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,611
on the bottom layer of the Outline Layer.

146
00:07:01,102 --> 00:07:02,886
Remember when we learned about Clipping Masks?

147
00:07:02,887 --> 00:07:06,014
Press ALT to clip the layer above

148
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:09,182
or lock the layer itself to prevent it

149
00:07:09,207 --> 00:07:12,410
from sticking out even if you apply other colors.

150
00:07:12,447 --> 00:07:15,512
If you do this, it'll be easier to color later.

151
00:07:16,216 --> 00:07:19,233
The second step is matching the colors.

152
00:07:20,288 --> 00:07:21,905
I'm going to apply the color I want.

153
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:27,573
I'll apply the primary color of the color scheme I'm going for, like this.

154
00:07:27,943 --> 00:07:30,142
But there's one thing I need to do first.

155
00:07:30,143 --> 00:07:31,598
What you need to do before coloring

156
00:07:31,683 --> 00:07:34,827
is lighting.

157
00:07:34,858 --> 00:07:37,816
This time, I'm going to skip this part halfway.

158
00:07:38,387 --> 00:07:39,604
Why would I do that?

159
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:43,136
We're going to change the lighting according to the atmosphere in the next lecture,

160
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:45,038
so I'm going to apply lighting as briefly as possible

161
00:07:45,063 --> 00:07:46,762
and start coloring it right away.

162
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:50,387
But actually, you have to apply the lighting before you color it.

163
00:07:50,412 --> 00:07:51,448
But why?

164
00:07:51,448 --> 00:07:57,621
This coloring is based on the frontal light.

165
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,980
The light that this character receives as a whole,

166
00:08:03,302 --> 00:08:05,764
or the color of the space that this character is in,

167
00:08:05,765 --> 00:08:08,163
would be the background color, or background light.

168
00:08:08,164 --> 00:08:11,636
When the character gets that kind of light,

169
00:08:11,638 --> 00:08:13,614
you have to make it the base color,

170
00:08:14,081 --> 00:08:15,794
so you have to decide on the lighting first

171
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:17,752
so that you can definitely color it.

172
00:08:17,754 --> 00:08:20,779
For example, I'm going to draw a night background,

173
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,603
so the character will absorb blue lighting overall,

174
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:26,202
so it'll be a little bluish.

175
00:08:26,275 --> 00:08:29,103
But if you don't pay attention to it during the coloring stage,

176
00:08:29,128 --> 00:08:31,988
and if you apply raw white or raw yellow,

177
00:08:32,013 --> 00:08:35,033
it's going to be a color that doesn't go well with the night background.

178
00:08:35,034 --> 00:08:37,311
In the end, you need to edit all of this later.

179
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,091
If you do that, you have to work more.

180
00:08:40,184 --> 00:08:42,199
The color will be awkward during the editing process.

181
00:08:42,403 --> 00:08:45,083
So, it's important to

182
00:08:45,084 --> 00:08:46,720
set the lighting

183
00:08:46,745 --> 00:08:48,011
before you start coloring.

184
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:51,655
Now that we're done coloring according to the lighting,

185
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:54,131
we're going to give it some light.

186
00:08:56,899 --> 00:08:59,296
If the previous step was to decide on the lighting,

187
00:09:00,509 --> 00:09:02,335
the latter one is to apply the lighting.

188
00:09:02,815 --> 00:09:04,673
I'm going to add a simple shadow.

189
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,339
At this stage,

190
00:09:07,424 --> 00:09:09,859
what I'm going to show you in the demonstration is

191
00:09:09,869 --> 00:09:12,331
a bit like doing cel animation.

192
00:09:12,332 --> 00:09:15,098
I'm going to color it like cel animation.

193
00:09:15,517 --> 00:09:17,478
These days, the term "cel animation" is a bit vague.

194
00:09:17,479 --> 00:09:22,451
I'm not sure what to say since the meaning has changed a lot these days.

195
00:09:24,847 --> 00:09:27,080
I'm going to go through the process of applying the lighting simply

196
00:09:27,082 --> 00:09:29,903
like an animation.

197
00:09:30,104 --> 00:09:32,820
And then we go into the description process.

198
00:09:33,011 --> 00:09:34,897
We're going to go through a series of processes.

199
00:09:34,898 --> 00:09:36,355
Today, we're going through

200
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:39,272
these steps

201
00:09:41,094 --> 00:09:43,121
from here to here.

202
00:09:43,287 --> 00:09:44,601
Then, let's go on.

203
00:09:44,802 --> 00:09:46,368
I'm going to apply the base color first.

204
00:09:46,812 --> 00:09:48,485
There needs to be a prepared outline.

205
00:09:49,411 --> 00:09:52,083
If you have the outlines, you can easily paint underneath it.

206
00:09:52,084 --> 00:09:53,383
How do you do that?

207
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:54,564
It's based on Photoshop.

208
00:09:54,565 --> 00:09:56,233
Clip Studio Paint is a little easier.

209
00:09:56,234 --> 00:09:57,909
It's because Clip Studio Paint

210
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,663
has a better Select function.

211
00:10:00,362 --> 00:10:01,370
So, it's easier.

212
00:10:01,371 --> 00:10:02,851
The Pen tool and the Select tool

213
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,659
are optimized for drawing lines,

214
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,696
so Photoshop users

215
00:10:05,697 --> 00:10:07,856
need to endure some discomfort.

216
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:10,950
I wish there was a good way to do this,

217
00:10:12,066 --> 00:10:13,899
but I haven't figured it out yet.

218
00:10:14,768 --> 00:10:17,950
First, please select the background part like this.

219
00:10:19,797 --> 00:10:22,201
Press the Shift key to select more.

220
00:10:22,202 --> 00:10:24,822
If you press the Alt key, it's deselected.

221
00:10:27,587 --> 00:10:30,641
Let's use that to select the background

222
00:10:31,405 --> 00:10:32,690
with the Shift key.

223
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,298
If possible, it's better to

224
00:10:39,323 --> 00:10:40,812
draw the outline neatly.

225
00:10:45,697 --> 00:10:48,623
Now, we selected the background.

226
00:10:49,387 --> 00:10:50,830
So, what makes Photoshop

227
00:10:51,115 --> 00:10:53,128
a bit annoying to use?

228
00:10:53,912 --> 00:10:56,469
I'll press Ctrl-H to hide the dotted line.

229
00:10:56,494 --> 00:10:59,800
If you paint it like this, there are subtle dots left on the edges.

230
00:11:00,397 --> 00:11:03,218
There aren't that many left, but it's very uncomfortable.

231
00:11:03,927 --> 00:11:06,208
So, how do we hide them?

232
00:11:06,526 --> 00:11:12,078
If you go into [Select] - [Modify] - [Expand],

233
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,264
you can zoom in on this, selecting

234
00:11:13,289 --> 00:11:15,610
as many pixels as you want.

235
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:17,830
If you zoom in about two pixels,

236
00:11:21,402 --> 00:11:23,805
it's going to invade the line like this.

237
00:11:25,196 --> 00:11:29,377
Now, if you paint it like this, you'll see that the uncomfortable parts

238
00:11:29,402 --> 00:11:31,348
you saw earlier are not visible.

239
00:11:31,585 --> 00:11:32,675
In this state,

240
00:11:33,816 --> 00:11:36,486
right-click in the Selection Tool state

241
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,062
and you will see these windows

242
00:11:39,205 --> 00:11:41,749
where you will reverse select.

243
00:11:42,331 --> 00:11:44,579
Now that you selected the opposite of the background,

244
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,803
what do you think you selected?

245
00:11:45,804 --> 00:11:47,183
Of course, it's the character.

246
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,771
The background became selected, too.

247
00:11:54,488 --> 00:12:01,695
Let's remove it in a similar way.

248
00:12:02,992 --> 00:12:07,006
If you do this, you can apply the base color as quickly as possible.

249
00:12:08,384 --> 00:12:11,227
It doesn't matter what color you use for the base color.

250
00:12:11,228 --> 00:12:13,404
It's okay if you can just tell the difference.

251
00:12:15,103 --> 00:12:16,509
We're dividing the areas, so

252
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,832
there are people who are dividing the

253
00:12:19,834 --> 00:12:21,378
outfits, skin, and hair layers,

254
00:12:21,726 --> 00:12:24,541
and there are people who are using one layer like I am right now.

255
00:12:24,542 --> 00:12:29,003
That's the difference in

256
00:12:29,004 --> 00:12:30,321
how you feel comfortable working,

257
00:12:30,322 --> 00:12:32,027
so there's no fixed answer,

258
00:12:32,028 --> 00:12:33,194
but there are pros and cons.

259
00:12:33,195 --> 00:12:35,323
If the layers are divided into parts,

260
00:12:35,324 --> 00:12:38,605
you can prevent the color

261
00:12:38,606 --> 00:12:40,219
from spreading.

262
00:12:40,978 --> 00:12:42,354
So, the advantage is that you can

263
00:12:42,354 --> 00:12:43,808
color in more accurately,

264
00:12:43,809 --> 00:12:46,644
but the overall color correction process is annoying,

265
00:12:46,646 --> 00:12:49,333
so sometimes the uniformity is a little weak.

266
00:12:49,385 --> 00:12:52,098
To put it the other way around, if it's colored like this

267
00:12:52,099 --> 00:12:54,405
then the sense of unity might be stronger,

268
00:12:54,622 --> 00:12:58,331
but the whole color could be mixed.

269
00:12:58,332 --> 00:13:00,782
So, you can take that into consideration

270
00:13:00,784 --> 00:13:03,107
and proceed according to

271
00:13:03,108 --> 00:13:04,184
where you need it.

272
00:13:04,185 --> 00:13:05,895
I usually prioritize the sense of unity

273
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,757
when I proceed with illustrations,

274
00:13:07,758 --> 00:13:09,353
so I am proceeding as I am doing now.

275
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:19,722
Now that I've done the base color,

276
00:13:21,922 --> 00:13:24,583
I'll color the primary colors.

277
00:13:26,909 --> 00:13:28,691
The tentacles in the back were white.

278
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:34,110
I'll color it with some grayish colors and a bit of a bluish colors.

279
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:35,928
This time, I'm going to set the space color

280
00:13:35,929 --> 00:13:37,057
to a bluish color

281
00:13:37,058 --> 00:13:39,590
and give it low saturation.

282
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:43,305
So I'm going to add that kind of light to this character.

283
00:13:43,711 --> 00:13:45,323
I'll create a layer

284
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,912
and apply a Clipping Mask.

285
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,386
At this stage, if possible,

286
00:13:54,386 --> 00:13:56,398
I recommend turning off the pen pressure at this stage if possible.

287
00:13:57,409 --> 00:13:59,000
You don't have to turn it on,

288
00:14:02,567 --> 00:14:05,820
so let's color it in the widest area

289
00:14:05,822 --> 00:14:06,830
just once

290
00:14:07,295 --> 00:14:12,186
and color in the base colors for each part.

291
00:14:21,885 --> 00:14:24,407
It's a work that requires a bit of manual labor.

292
00:14:34,154 --> 00:14:37,604
Today's main purpose is to rough in colors.

293
00:14:37,738 --> 00:14:40,999
I'll use some remaining time to explain about it.

294
00:14:41,173 --> 00:14:42,190
Roughing in colors.

295
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:45,689
If there's the thumbnail sketching stage in the sketching,

296
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,106
there is the color roughing stage in the coloring stage.

297
00:14:48,312 --> 00:14:52,074
Of course, it's the stage where you try to make the image you were imagining.

298
00:14:52,307 --> 00:14:55,186
That means that the thumbnail is done,

299
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:58,114
and we did the 2nd sketch from there,

300
00:14:58,601 --> 00:15:00,526
and now we applied the color underneath it.

301
00:15:01,204 --> 00:15:02,782
We even did the color rough.

302
00:15:02,885 --> 00:15:05,571
So, that image is not that different

303
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:06,813
from a completed image.

304
00:15:06,994 --> 00:15:08,600
The only thing that's different is the quality.

305
00:15:08,786 --> 00:15:10,205
The degree of simple depiction

306
00:15:10,206 --> 00:15:12,912
is only different from how much I've done,

307
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,268
but in fact,

308
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:17,486
the painting is almost done in the color rough stage.

309
00:15:17,798 --> 00:15:20,098
Of course, there are people who

310
00:15:20,099 --> 00:15:21,896
spend a lot of time expressing things later.

311
00:15:22,498 --> 00:15:24,588
But in terms of the composition of the drawing,

312
00:15:24,598 --> 00:15:26,968
it's done in the color rough phase.

313
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:28,578
So please don't think that

314
00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:31,822
this roughing in step is simple.

315
00:15:32,186 --> 00:15:35,147
This is also a very important stage

316
00:15:35,148 --> 00:15:37,164
like the thumbnails we did before,

317
00:15:37,165 --> 00:15:42,625
and if you consider this work a little too lightly,

318
00:15:42,626 --> 00:15:45,902
or if you look down on this process,

319
00:15:45,927 --> 00:15:47,203
you'll have many errors

320
00:15:47,302 --> 00:15:50,838
when you work on it later.

321
00:15:52,784 --> 00:15:54,608
So, what kind of mistakes can you make?

322
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:58,711
Let's say you wanted to do a different theme

323
00:15:58,712 --> 00:16:01,986
from your previous works.

324
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:04,010
After you proceed in your work,

325
00:16:04,165 --> 00:16:06,307
you'd eventually be done.

326
00:16:06,844 --> 00:16:08,729
You wanted to try something different this time,

327
00:16:08,729 --> 00:16:11,192
but you will get the same result as before.

328
00:16:11,193 --> 00:16:12,579
You'll have those kind of errors.

329
00:16:13,977 --> 00:16:15,615
As I said before,

330
00:16:15,695 --> 00:16:18,701
people don't have a long image memory.

331
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,828
Because of that,

332
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:23,103
we forget the image

333
00:16:23,104 --> 00:16:25,421
that we previously thought of.

334
00:16:25,895 --> 00:16:28,046
So, in that time,

335
00:16:28,048 --> 00:16:31,136
the habits that you previously had

336
00:16:31,137 --> 00:16:32,510
affect your illustration.

337
00:16:32,921 --> 00:16:36,344
So, you should do the color roughing stage as quickly as possible.

338
00:16:36,345 --> 00:16:40,703
That way, you'll minimize the possibility

339
00:16:41,314 --> 00:16:44,875
of your previous habits getting in the way.

340
00:16:49,202 --> 00:16:51,441
Then, how should you practice color roughing?

341
00:16:51,442 --> 00:16:53,587
I usually say it at the end of my lectures,

342
00:16:53,588 --> 00:16:56,535
but I'll say it first today.

343
00:16:56,536 --> 00:16:59,835
When you color in basic colors, you can do it as you want.

344
00:17:02,574 --> 00:17:05,643
You can practice roughing in the colors

345
00:17:05,644 --> 00:17:06,655
by just doing that,

346
00:17:06,656 --> 00:17:09,206
but, like thumbnails, you can use references.

347
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,065
In the thumbnail process,

348
00:17:11,065 --> 00:17:13,514
I told you to set a reference.

349
00:17:14,384 --> 00:17:15,713
Likewise,

350
00:17:17,484 --> 00:17:18,714
color imitation

351
00:17:19,545 --> 00:17:22,535
has its references from real life too.

352
00:17:22,536 --> 00:17:25,469
So, you should look at illustrations

353
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:28,229
to copy in dimensions.

354
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:32,728
You don't have to do it in detail.

355
00:17:32,729 --> 00:17:35,898
You can just simply color your illustrations.

356
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:39,186
You can practice

357
00:17:39,187 --> 00:17:42,771
for about 40 minutes to one hour

358
00:17:42,772 --> 00:17:45,053
and copy the drawing with dimensions.

359
00:17:45,078 --> 00:17:47,508
You should copy it without sketching

360
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,552
and copy with dimensions.

361
00:17:50,325 --> 00:17:51,642
Of course, when you're drawing,

362
00:17:55,881 --> 00:18:00,215
it's best to use the Eyedropper tool as little as possible.

363
00:18:00,216 --> 00:18:03,331
It's important to understand the colors that are in there.

364
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:05,301
So, I'm not going to use the Eyedropper tool.

365
00:18:05,989 --> 00:18:09,413
I'm going to choose directly from the Color Picker.

366
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:13,960
I'm going to pick the same color

367
00:18:13,961 --> 00:18:16,420
and increase it one by one.

368
00:18:16,482 --> 00:18:20,653
If you do it for the first time,

369
00:18:20,678 --> 00:18:22,309
it'll be very different from the color that you saw.

370
00:18:24,097 --> 00:18:25,632
For example,

371
00:18:25,726 --> 00:18:28,820
you might think the color is a high saturated blue color.

372
00:18:29,022 --> 00:18:32,641
But, when you actually color it, it could be very different from what you saw.

373
00:18:32,642 --> 00:18:34,920
For instance, when you use the Eyedropper,

374
00:18:35,001 --> 00:18:37,291
it might actually be a low saturated purple color.

375
00:18:37,598 --> 00:18:40,068
There could be many differences from what you thought.

376
00:18:40,282 --> 00:18:42,776
That's because of an optical illusion.

377
00:18:42,801 --> 00:18:45,275
Previously, we learned the contrast between warm and cool colors.

378
00:18:45,277 --> 00:18:47,934
We're going to reduce the errors

379
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,688
that are commonly made at this stage.

380
00:18:50,492 --> 00:18:53,831
It helps a lot in the color roughing process.

381
00:18:57,205 --> 00:19:00,012
So, I recommend that you study

382
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:02,024
by copying the dimensions.

383
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:05,178
The thing with copying the dimensions is

384
00:19:05,203 --> 00:19:06,642
you won't do it unless someone tells you to.

385
00:19:06,643 --> 00:19:08,411
Some of you might not do it even after taking this class.

386
00:19:08,585 --> 00:19:10,724
So, I strongly recommend you to do this.

387
00:19:11,694 --> 00:19:13,647
It will help you if you do it.

388
00:19:13,854 --> 00:19:16,285
I believe it will help you a lot.

389
00:19:16,387 --> 00:19:17,948
Practicing with the color roughing

390
00:19:17,966 --> 00:19:19,812
is very important.

391
00:19:21,424 --> 00:19:24,206
So, roughing in by using colors

392
00:19:24,713 --> 00:19:27,061
will help you with the coloring stage.

393
00:19:28,885 --> 00:19:32,179
In my case, I gather students every Tuesday

394
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,573
and force them to do it.

395
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:36,905
Of course, I do it with them.

396
00:19:39,591 --> 00:19:42,122
Since we're doing the assignments together,

397
00:19:45,903 --> 00:19:48,113
we're going to color in the metal parts.

398
00:19:48,193 --> 00:19:50,597
I'll give you some tips for coloring metal parts.

399
00:19:50,744 --> 00:19:54,207
Basically, metal has a strong contrast.

400
00:19:55,806 --> 00:19:56,900
What I'm saying is that

401
00:19:56,925 --> 00:19:58,967
metal materials are strongly reflective.

402
00:19:58,968 --> 00:20:00,181
They sparkle.

403
00:20:00,385 --> 00:20:02,986
So to give it a sparkly look,

404
00:20:02,987 --> 00:20:04,473
it's good to use dark colors for the base color

405
00:20:04,475 --> 00:20:06,553
when you color metal.

406
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,171
If the base color is too bright,

407
00:20:09,172 --> 00:20:12,164
it doesn't feel bright when you add highlights.

408
00:20:12,522 --> 00:20:15,260
Then, the amount of work will increase,

409
00:20:15,285 --> 00:20:16,866
so using dark colors

410
00:20:16,867 --> 00:20:18,488
for the base color

411
00:20:18,513 --> 00:20:21,705
will increase the stability when you're coloring.

412
00:20:21,772 --> 00:20:23,687
If you want to be a concept artist,

413
00:20:23,712 --> 00:20:25,662
you'll use a lot of warm tone colors,

414
00:20:25,687 --> 00:20:27,093
and you'll use them a lot then.

415
00:20:27,095 --> 00:20:28,964
Especially, when you draw metal,

416
00:20:28,965 --> 00:20:30,381
when you draw yellow metal,

417
00:20:31,802 --> 00:20:34,687
like gold,

418
00:20:34,688 --> 00:20:35,971
people usually color in yellow.

419
00:20:35,972 --> 00:20:37,187
Very bright yellow.

420
00:20:37,212 --> 00:20:38,604
You should never do that.

421
00:20:38,785 --> 00:20:41,015
So, how would you describe gold?

422
00:20:42,703 --> 00:20:44,072
Use this color.

423
00:20:44,394 --> 00:20:46,602
It definitely looks brown,

424
00:20:46,633 --> 00:20:50,904
But, later, we're going to add highlights

425
00:20:53,651 --> 00:20:55,084
like this.

426
00:20:55,109 --> 00:20:56,542
So, when you're coloring metal,

427
00:20:56,542 --> 00:20:58,212
the base color should be brown.

428
00:20:58,214 --> 00:21:00,423
I recommend you use dark colors.

429
00:21:02,656 --> 00:21:05,487
For those who want to color yellow even if it's hard,

430
00:21:05,512 --> 00:21:07,096
it doesn't matter if you do that,

431
00:21:07,218 --> 00:21:10,193
but, I want to tell you that this process will be hard.

432
00:21:16,491 --> 00:21:19,217
Fortunately, this character's color is quite simple.

433
00:21:19,492 --> 00:21:22,107
So, I don't think I'll waste that much time coloring the base colors.

434
00:21:29,584 --> 00:21:32,297
To this character, I've applied some of

435
00:21:32,307 --> 00:21:34,396
the previous character's design.

436
00:21:55,762 --> 00:21:57,545
I'll quickly color the base colors

437
00:21:58,413 --> 00:22:03,099
and continue with the lights and shadows, which is today's topic.

438
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:11,611
The reason why people find it difficult at this stage is

439
00:22:12,222 --> 00:22:16,018
they usually don't know what color it will become if this area looks dark.

440
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:18,249
That's the biggest challenge.

441
00:22:18,784 --> 00:22:21,793
And people don't know exactly where it should be dark.

442
00:22:22,305 --> 00:22:24,938
That's the second hardest part.

443
00:22:26,017 --> 00:22:28,857
Especially with the second hardest part,

444
00:22:28,858 --> 00:22:30,500
it's related to drawing theories.

445
00:22:30,525 --> 00:22:32,275
Of course, it's the same for the first one.

446
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,629
I think for the first one, it's also related to applying deformers.

447
00:22:34,654 --> 00:22:37,283
But the second one is really theoretical.

448
00:22:37,308 --> 00:22:40,355
If the light comes from this direction, this object gets light like this.

449
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,582
You have to predict this.

450
00:22:42,607 --> 00:22:44,703
If you want to practice that part,

451
00:22:44,728 --> 00:22:47,212
rather than practicing coloring, you need to practice drawing.

452
00:22:48,103 --> 00:22:49,184
So, let's say you decided on the light.

453
00:22:49,186 --> 00:22:50,806
The light came from the right

454
00:22:51,304 --> 00:22:52,916
and so you colored it like that.

455
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,940
But, the final result might not look like this.

456
00:22:54,965 --> 00:22:59,108
This happens when you don't clearly understand the form

457
00:22:59,685 --> 00:23:02,333
when there's light, so you can't shade it in.

458
00:23:02,358 --> 00:23:04,804
So if you're in that situation,

459
00:23:05,026 --> 00:23:06,504
then, you need to practice with forms.

460
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,808
You shouldn't practice coloring.

461
00:23:09,507 --> 00:23:11,711
If you draw with your hands,

462
00:23:11,711 --> 00:23:15,408
you can observe the overall form of an object.

463
00:23:15,433 --> 00:23:17,920
It's much more effective if you practice like that.

464
00:23:18,445 --> 00:23:20,466
So when you work on coloring,

465
00:23:20,491 --> 00:23:22,976
and if it doesn't look fancy but flat,

466
00:23:23,303 --> 00:23:24,971
you need to go back,

467
00:23:24,996 --> 00:23:26,820
to the drawing part.

468
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,114
Not all,

469
00:23:31,139 --> 00:23:33,396
but some people who have difficulties like that,

470
00:23:33,397 --> 00:23:34,918
are a bit careless about drawing.

471
00:23:35,968 --> 00:23:39,350
There are a lot of people who didn't draw well.

472
00:23:40,514 --> 00:23:43,482
When it's hard to color it, they hold it for a long time.

473
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:45,654
I've seen a lot of people

474
00:23:45,655 --> 00:23:46,692
who don't spend a lot of time on drawing.

475
00:23:46,978 --> 00:23:49,533
Make sure you don't do that.

476
00:23:53,097 --> 00:23:56,602
While I'm talking, I'm almost done with the coloring.

477
00:23:57,591 --> 00:23:59,801
Also,

478
00:24:00,416 --> 00:24:02,551
the colors will be very different depending on the monitor.

479
00:24:02,552 --> 00:24:04,219
Especially the monitor that you're working on,

480
00:24:04,219 --> 00:24:06,121
it might not be accurate.

481
00:24:06,302 --> 00:24:08,496
But the monitors of the viewers are not the same.

482
00:24:08,883 --> 00:24:11,265
Then since many people might see it,

483
00:24:11,267 --> 00:24:13,111
it's important to draw a good color.

484
00:24:13,397 --> 00:24:15,020
So the most effective method is

485
00:24:15,021 --> 00:24:17,616
to looking at multiple monitors simultaneously.

486
00:24:19,297 --> 00:24:20,657
If you have dual monitors,

487
00:24:20,658 --> 00:24:23,666
or a main monitor with a sub monitor is good, too.

488
00:24:23,901 --> 00:24:25,711
If you don't have them,

489
00:24:25,712 --> 00:24:26,817
you can use your cell phone.

490
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,681
There are not many people who don't have a cell phone.

491
00:24:31,374 --> 00:24:34,165
So you can use your cell phone to check it.

492
00:24:34,549 --> 00:24:36,812
Or if you have an iPad, you can use that.

493
00:24:36,813 --> 00:24:38,047
Or ask a friend if you can use their phone.

494
00:24:38,048 --> 00:24:39,940
It's good to borrow someone else's phone and take a look at it.

495
00:24:40,307 --> 00:24:42,090
By checking it through various methods,

496
00:24:42,091 --> 00:24:44,619
the color of your drawing will change little by little.

497
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:48,768
So, to make all of those parts nicely,

498
00:24:48,777 --> 00:24:50,077
it would be good

499
00:24:50,078 --> 00:24:51,675
to have some time to match things up.

500
00:24:52,288 --> 00:24:53,930
It's one of the most important parts.

501
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,067
The more sensitive

502
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:59,607
you get in sensing the color,

503
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,258
if there's even a tiny color difference in each monitor,

504
00:25:02,258 --> 00:25:03,591
you may get really angry about it later on.

505
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:06,013
There might be people who have experienced this.

506
00:25:07,201 --> 00:25:09,484
So, I can't do anything about it.

507
00:25:09,617 --> 00:25:11,214
It's not like the monitor that we use

508
00:25:11,216 --> 00:25:13,213
is exactly the same as another person's.

509
00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:15,112
So we just need to make sure

510
00:25:15,137 --> 00:25:16,587
by checking many different monitors.

511
00:25:24,494 --> 00:25:27,014
Now, I'm going to color in the gloves.

512
00:25:31,417 --> 00:25:33,948
If you paint the inside of this outfit,

513
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,066
it's almost done.

514
00:25:35,305 --> 00:25:37,109
It's good to color it neatly,

515
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,605
so that there's nothing that sticks out more than this.

516
00:25:38,607 --> 00:25:40,901
Since I have to do it quickly for demonstration purposes today,

517
00:25:40,926 --> 00:25:42,454
with the parts that stick out,

518
00:25:42,479 --> 00:25:45,012
please pretend that they aren't sticking out.

519
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,328
Please do that.

520
00:25:53,674 --> 00:25:56,326
Pretend that they are not sticking out.

521
00:26:00,223 --> 00:26:01,694
I'll work on the tentacle at the front, too.

522
00:26:06,093 --> 00:26:07,266
Now, here I'll tell you

523
00:26:07,267 --> 00:26:08,642
a function of Photoshop.

524
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,606
I drew a tentacle in the front,

525
00:26:10,631 --> 00:26:12,108
but I didn't draw its outline.

526
00:26:12,219 --> 00:26:13,625
I'll tell you a tip.

527
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:16,678
If you press the FX in the lower right corner,

528
00:26:16,703 --> 00:26:18,799
you can apply various effects to the layer.

529
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,054
There's something called Outer Glow.

530
00:26:21,188 --> 00:26:23,266
The default setting is Screen,

531
00:26:23,268 --> 00:26:24,933
so it shines like this.

532
00:26:25,173 --> 00:26:27,519
If I briefly tell you about the types of layers,

533
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:28,718
Normal is when

534
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,778
we just colored it in.

535
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,019
Multiply

536
00:26:32,127 --> 00:26:34,183
adds a little shadow on the bottom.

537
00:26:34,208 --> 00:26:36,417
You can think of it as adding cellophane paper.

538
00:26:37,994 --> 00:26:39,009
Lighten

539
00:26:39,911 --> 00:26:42,615
only applies brighter colors than the bottom.

540
00:26:42,946 --> 00:26:44,250
So, when there's white at the bottom,

541
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,485
nothing's going to happen.

542
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,545
For example, if I make this color black,

543
00:26:49,546 --> 00:26:51,192
because these colors are brighter than black,

544
00:26:51,194 --> 00:26:52,665
nothing's going to happen.

545
00:26:53,709 --> 00:26:55,491
On the other hand, Darken,

546
00:26:58,218 --> 00:26:59,250
this function

547
00:26:59,372 --> 00:27:02,389
is basically the same. It would color darker colors than the bottom.

548
00:27:02,769 --> 00:27:05,399
So, if you set this color as white, nothing happens.

549
00:27:08,778 --> 00:27:10,511
And Screen.

550
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:13,490
It feels like I applied light to the bottom layer.

551
00:27:13,515 --> 00:27:15,474
It becomes brighter.

552
00:27:15,499 --> 00:27:17,571
But, it's not because the saturation is higher.

553
00:27:17,596 --> 00:27:20,317
Instead, it's more like giving light to the color.

554
00:27:20,342 --> 00:27:22,703
So, it will be a bit brighter.

555
00:27:23,184 --> 00:27:24,226
Overlay.

556
00:27:24,286 --> 00:27:25,757
This one becomes a little more bright.

557
00:27:25,782 --> 00:27:27,424
The saturation becomes stronger

558
00:27:27,493 --> 00:27:30,342
and it's kind of like burning the picture.

559
00:27:30,367 --> 00:27:31,390
So, that's Overlay.

560
00:27:31,511 --> 00:27:33,399
These are the ones that are used often.

561
00:27:33,506 --> 00:27:36,541
Overlay, Soft Light, Lighten.

562
00:27:36,589 --> 00:27:38,275
Darken, Normal.

563
00:27:38,463 --> 00:27:39,815
Even if you just know these five,

564
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,413
you can work on most illustrations.

565
00:27:41,438 --> 00:27:43,897
What we're going to use now is Normal.

566
00:27:46,885 --> 00:27:51,416
I'll choose a color that's appropriate for the exterior.

567
00:27:51,812 --> 00:27:53,376
If you reduce the size as much as possible,

568
00:27:54,193 --> 00:27:55,620
it's kind of like an outline.

569
00:27:57,001 --> 00:27:59,052
This is how you can quickly draw the outline of the tentacle.

570
00:28:03,877 --> 00:28:06,494
If you can't see the line, change it to black.

571
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:15,460
It's a good method to use when you're too lazy to draw outlines.

572
00:28:22,292 --> 00:28:25,112
Now that I'm done coloring, I'm going to add some shadows.

573
00:28:25,598 --> 00:28:26,942
As I said before,

574
00:28:26,943 --> 00:28:29,192
I'm going to give it a simple light.

575
00:28:29,194 --> 00:28:31,789
That way, I can change the light in many ways

576
00:28:31,814 --> 00:28:33,929
to match the character's mood.

577
00:28:34,186 --> 00:28:37,208
First, I'll tell you what kind of light I'll use.

578
00:28:37,233 --> 00:28:39,734
For the lighting, it's always good to draw a chart

579
00:28:42,988 --> 00:28:46,006
for how you're going to give the light.

580
00:28:46,008 --> 00:28:47,023
This.

581
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,484
What should I do?

582
00:28:49,964 --> 00:28:51,693
Light, Table.

583
00:28:52,705 --> 00:28:54,245
There are four things you have to think about.

584
00:28:54,246 --> 00:28:56,089
First, the number of light sources.

585
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:57,428
And the amount of it.

586
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,619
Second, the direction of light.

587
00:28:59,819 --> 00:29:00,992
The starting point of the light

588
00:29:03,098 --> 00:29:04,215
is important as well.

589
00:29:05,254 --> 00:29:07,156
The third one is the color.

590
00:29:07,181 --> 00:29:08,492
The color we are going to use.

591
00:29:10,029 --> 00:29:12,202
Fourth, the density of light.

592
00:29:12,227 --> 00:29:13,635
How dense the light will be.

593
00:29:14,531 --> 00:29:16,595
If you can think of these four things,

594
00:29:16,596 --> 00:29:18,178
then you set a certain level of detail

595
00:29:18,203 --> 00:29:20,608
regarding the light before we work on it.

596
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:23,165
So I mentioned background color earlier.

597
00:29:23,396 --> 00:29:25,503
I applied the blue with a low saturation

598
00:29:25,683 --> 00:29:27,449
to the light coming from the entire space.

599
00:29:29,206 --> 00:29:30,825
I made this density low.

600
00:29:32,185 --> 00:29:33,993
Because I made it a bit dark.

601
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:36,888
And where should I give the light?

602
00:29:38,617 --> 00:29:44,542
Slightly right above from the center.

603
00:29:47,209 --> 00:29:50,102
I'll give light to the character from here.

604
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:56,508
The color is close to white light, but it's kind of blue.

605
00:29:57,471 --> 00:30:00,185
Among the blue ones, it's a turquoise color.

606
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:02,515
The density is a bit strong.

607
00:30:02,517 --> 00:30:05,018
I'm going to apply

608
00:30:06,674 --> 00:30:07,876
about the medium.

609
00:30:07,877 --> 00:30:09,788
Since the bottom floor is white,

610
00:30:09,813 --> 00:30:12,748
I'll position the reflective light coming up from the white floor.

611
00:30:12,953 --> 00:30:13,992
Floor.

612
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:17,484
When the main light comes in,

613
00:30:17,509 --> 00:30:19,685
the light is reflected in the surrounding background,

614
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:22,103
and go back to the character.

615
00:30:22,383 --> 00:30:24,820
So with the reflective light from the floor,

616
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,898
a very weak white light,

617
00:30:28,984 --> 00:30:30,023
the very weak one,

618
00:30:32,227 --> 00:30:35,215
I'm going to use these three lights.

619
00:30:35,302 --> 00:30:36,670
One important thing at this point is,

620
00:30:36,695 --> 00:30:38,332
please add the background color from your imagination.

621
00:30:38,882 --> 00:30:40,985
Sometimes, I call it frontal light.

622
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:42,642
Make sure to add the background color from your imagination.

623
00:30:43,268 --> 00:30:45,678
What happens if you don't add light?

624
00:30:46,603 --> 00:30:48,911
Let's review and do it again.

625
00:30:50,902 --> 00:30:55,127
When there's no light at night,

626
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:56,920
this person is standing like this,

627
00:30:57,078 --> 00:31:00,307
and if you turn on a flashlight,

628
00:31:00,332 --> 00:31:02,014
you won't be able to see this person's face.

629
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:05,685
Because there's no light other than the light from behind.

630
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:07,901
We can only see the silhouette of this person.

631
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:09,920
But when we give Backlight to our character,

632
00:31:09,945 --> 00:31:11,435
you don't draw it so that you can't see it.

633
00:31:11,609 --> 00:31:13,390
Do people draw characters like this?

634
00:31:14,395 --> 00:31:15,427
I don't think so.

635
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,506
When you draw characters, most of you draw them to see the front part.

636
00:31:18,709 --> 00:31:20,306
Then why do you see this?

637
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,726
It means there is light coming from the foreground, even though we don't see it.

638
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,605
I don't know what this light will be.

639
00:31:24,691 --> 00:31:27,379
Someone may be shooting the light from here,

640
00:31:27,606 --> 00:31:29,960
or the light behind it

641
00:31:29,962 --> 00:31:33,360
may be reflected by the wall.

642
00:31:33,385 --> 00:31:34,750
So they might come in from here.

643
00:31:36,526 --> 00:31:37,810
This is the background color.

644
00:31:38,514 --> 00:31:40,971
It comes in like this, and the light reflects off,

645
00:31:40,973 --> 00:31:42,727
so it could be coming into our eyes.

646
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:44,805
I don't know where this came from,

647
00:31:44,893 --> 00:31:47,349
but based on the fact that we're drawing characters,

648
00:31:47,351 --> 00:31:50,011
we could say this character is receiving

649
00:31:50,013 --> 00:31:51,615
the light from the front.

650
00:31:52,461 --> 00:31:56,225
So, make sure to give one spatial light.

651
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,899
There are not many cases when you don't have this.

652
00:31:59,401 --> 00:32:02,905
Unless it's an extreme situation, this won't happen.

653
00:32:03,562 --> 00:32:04,832
When you draw characters...

654
00:32:06,218 --> 00:32:07,932
Let's move on to the next one.

655
00:32:11,415 --> 00:32:12,917
Make a layer

656
00:32:13,495 --> 00:32:15,141
and create a Multiply Layer.

657
00:32:16,612 --> 00:32:18,083
There are two ways to do this.

658
00:32:18,522 --> 00:32:20,923
The Multiply Layer makes things dark.

659
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:23,688
You can apply light and shadow by using the Multiply Layer.

660
00:32:26,193 --> 00:32:28,083
You can work on the light and shadow this way.

661
00:32:28,108 --> 00:32:31,508
Or on the other hand, you can make the base color a bit darker.

662
00:32:33,387 --> 00:32:34,887
I'll color this a little darker.

663
00:32:34,889 --> 00:32:38,990
You can use the Screen Layer to add light.

664
00:32:40,005 --> 00:32:41,330
There are two ways.

665
00:32:42,221 --> 00:32:44,500
You can choose the one that's more comfortable.

666
00:32:44,501 --> 00:32:46,825
You could add in a lot of shadows,

667
00:32:46,827 --> 00:32:48,600
or alternatively, you could add in a lot of light.

668
00:32:49,493 --> 00:32:52,180
If you give a lot of light, there will be a lot of bright areas,

669
00:32:52,205 --> 00:32:54,394
so, you'll save time working on the dark areas.

670
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:57,195
To put it the other way around, if you're going to add a little light,

671
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,953
since there are a lot of dark areas,

672
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:02,804
you can finish with the bright areas much more quickly.

673
00:33:03,193 --> 00:33:05,018
It depends on your efficiency.

674
00:33:06,453 --> 00:33:08,507
If you want to go beyond just using the Multiply Layer,

675
00:33:08,614 --> 00:33:10,798
and just use the Normal Layer,

676
00:33:10,913 --> 00:33:12,173
you can do it like that,

677
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:14,688
but you'll have to work on your drawing a lot.

678
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:17,312
It's hard to use each color.

679
00:33:17,405 --> 00:33:19,533
It could be a bit difficult.

680
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,913
So, if this is too difficult for you,

681
00:33:22,683 --> 00:33:25,500
Use the Multiply Layer and apply any color.

682
00:33:25,598 --> 00:33:28,122
What's important is where the color is applied.

683
00:33:28,899 --> 00:33:30,741
The area where the color is applied is important.

684
00:33:32,307 --> 00:33:33,905
Just apply any color.

685
00:33:41,114 --> 00:33:42,293
Now that I'm done with this,

686
00:33:42,294 --> 00:33:43,551
I want to give the character

687
00:33:43,552 --> 00:33:45,613
a bluish light.

688
00:33:45,614 --> 00:33:47,255
Then, let's select this part

689
00:33:47,287 --> 00:33:49,325
and just give it blue color.

690
00:33:51,292 --> 00:33:52,338
Ctrl+U

691
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,841
I previously mentioned the three wonders of Photoshop.

692
00:33:53,902 --> 00:33:56,458
Ctrl+U, B, M

693
00:33:56,483 --> 00:33:57,576
You can use all of this

694
00:33:57,601 --> 00:34:00,023
until you have the character that you want.

695
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:09,028
So, you can work however suits you.

696
00:34:11,094 --> 00:34:14,511
For your information, I usually use the Normal Layer.

697
00:34:14,793 --> 00:34:16,940
I'm currently using the Multiply Layer

698
00:34:16,942 --> 00:34:18,297
because doing this is a bit easier.

699
00:34:18,299 --> 00:34:20,037
I think it'll be easier for you to approach.

700
00:34:20,038 --> 00:34:21,100
That's how I'll do it today.

701
00:34:23,632 --> 00:34:25,558
So, how would you choose the color of the light and shadow?

702
00:34:25,714 --> 00:34:27,558
We just gave it a blue light.

703
00:34:27,902 --> 00:34:30,426
That's why there's a bit more blue

704
00:34:30,434 --> 00:34:31,723
Even if you know that much,

705
00:34:31,741 --> 00:34:32,905
it's okay for now.

706
00:34:33,401 --> 00:34:34,864
I'm just going to continue.

707
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:37,579
If there's a part where you don't like the color,

708
00:34:37,604 --> 00:34:40,602
edit it as much as possible at this stage.

709
00:34:41,507 --> 00:34:43,575
If we edit the color like this,

710
00:34:43,576 --> 00:34:45,428
the color becomes awkward.

711
00:34:46,147 --> 00:34:48,656
But we're in the roughing stage now.

712
00:34:48,905 --> 00:34:51,088
No one complains that the roughed-in colors look weird.

713
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,233
We're going to modify it anyways later.

714
00:34:54,789 --> 00:34:58,524
So in the roughing stage, edit as much as you want to.

715
00:34:58,604 --> 00:35:00,527
You should edit the character

716
00:35:00,529 --> 00:35:01,867
until you get the design you want.

717
00:35:01,869 --> 00:35:03,400
That's why we rough in colors.

718
00:35:03,587 --> 00:35:04,907
I'm going to edit it as I like.

719
00:35:10,398 --> 00:35:13,005
I like to use the Lasso Tool at this stage.

720
00:35:13,212 --> 00:35:14,831
I'll select it like this.

721
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,427
If you draw with the Eraser Tool and the Brush Tool,

722
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,769
If you do it like this,

723
00:35:21,988 --> 00:35:23,993
we can work much faster.

724
00:35:23,995 --> 00:35:26,509
It's very useful when you're roughing in colors.

725
00:35:50,301 --> 00:35:54,966
Assuming that the light comes from the top left,

726
00:35:54,991 --> 00:35:56,736
where does the light come in?

727
00:35:56,761 --> 00:35:58,217
And where will the shadows come in?

728
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:00,791
It's important to think about the dimensions.

729
00:36:00,937 --> 00:36:03,644
You have to be able to keep looking at an object's three-dimensional aspect.

730
00:36:04,194 --> 00:36:06,000
Then, what's important?

731
00:36:06,001 --> 00:36:10,219
It's important to recognize it as

732
00:36:10,397 --> 00:36:13,177
an object

733
00:36:13,178 --> 00:36:14,690
instead of a skin or a clothing.

734
00:36:15,097 --> 00:36:16,989
So, it's just an object.

735
00:36:16,991 --> 00:36:19,052
We're not describing the material right now.

736
00:36:19,077 --> 00:36:21,030
Don't worry about the material at this stage.

737
00:36:21,055 --> 00:36:22,367
This isn't even the skin area.

738
00:36:22,392 --> 00:36:23,731
It's just clay.

739
00:36:24,798 --> 00:36:26,304
It's okay if you look at like that.

740
00:36:28,588 --> 00:36:30,743
This process is more important than you think.

741
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:34,668
When we're coloring the hair,

742
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,421
there are people who color like this.

743
00:36:38,685 --> 00:36:40,200
I'm sure that applies to some of you

744
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:42,643
who are watching this video.

745
00:36:43,094 --> 00:36:46,733
But, instead of coloring this hair,

746
00:36:47,602 --> 00:36:49,934
let's color a sphere that looks like this.

747
00:36:49,934 --> 00:36:50,940
Everyone colors like this.

748
00:36:50,941 --> 00:36:52,320
Let's color the edges dark.

749
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,145
But actually, the latter is true.

750
00:36:54,405 --> 00:36:56,118
There's no need to be this dark in the middle.

751
00:36:56,584 --> 00:36:58,760
We're coloring it like this

752
00:36:58,785 --> 00:37:00,405
because we think it's the hair.

753
00:37:00,965 --> 00:37:02,521
But, I'll exclude this thought.

754
00:37:02,523 --> 00:37:05,355
If you simply think of this as a three-dimensional object,

755
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:06,994
then you can color it more accurately.

756
00:37:08,646 --> 00:37:10,826
Then, the lighting and shading will be quite accurate.

757
00:37:11,185 --> 00:37:13,051
So, when you color,

758
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,664
if you haven't thought like that before,

759
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:16,746
I hope you change your perception.

760
00:37:30,183 --> 00:37:32,487
It's going to make a big difference.

761
00:37:44,296 --> 00:37:47,216
Now, I'll tell you about the order of drawing when you want to give shadows.

762
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,102
There are three main types of shadows.

763
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:52,205
The first one is Cast Shadow.

764
00:37:52,449 --> 00:37:54,527
It's the shadow between things.

765
00:37:54,528 --> 00:37:55,566
It's simple.

766
00:37:55,566 --> 00:37:56,770
Because of the object up above,

767
00:37:56,778 --> 00:37:58,636
shadows are cast on the things below.

768
00:37:58,881 --> 00:38:02,000
The clothes that receive shadow because of the hair,

769
00:38:05,637 --> 00:38:08,425
or the arms that receive shadow because of the head,

770
00:38:09,009 --> 00:38:11,620
these shadows are called Cast Shadows.

771
00:38:12,013 --> 00:38:13,513
And then there's Form Shadow.

772
00:38:13,979 --> 00:38:16,205
It's formed because of the object's is three dimensional.

773
00:38:16,206 --> 00:38:18,393
This one goes around like this.

774
00:38:18,677 --> 00:38:20,512
As much as it goes around,

775
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:22,178
the middle area receives a lot of light,

776
00:38:22,179 --> 00:38:23,716
and the edges will receive less light.

777
00:38:23,898 --> 00:38:26,422
So, Form Shadows are formed when an object becomes dark like that.

778
00:38:31,814 --> 00:38:34,757
The third one is Ambient Occlusion.

779
00:38:34,758 --> 00:38:35,856
You can look at it like this.

780
00:38:35,857 --> 00:38:39,246
Ambient Occlusion is part of Cast Shadow.

781
00:38:39,247 --> 00:38:41,222
It's part of Cast Shadow,

782
00:38:41,306 --> 00:38:43,529
but as it's confusing,

783
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,821
I just separated it into three types of shadows.

784
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,779
This Form Shadow

785
00:38:48,878 --> 00:38:50,899
has less contrast than Cast Shadow.

786
00:38:51,008 --> 00:38:52,011
This is because

787
00:38:52,019 --> 00:38:55,234
this one is completely dark because the light is blocked by the object on top.

788
00:38:55,484 --> 00:38:57,419
It's really hard for light to come in.

789
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:59,065
But, with Form Shadows, an object receives light.

790
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:00,403
It just has a little bit of turn.

791
00:39:01,076 --> 00:39:04,100
It's not that it doesn't get much light.

792
00:39:04,588 --> 00:39:07,812
So, Form Shadow has less contrast.

793
00:39:07,837 --> 00:39:09,195
Which means it's less dark.

794
00:39:09,492 --> 00:39:11,433
So, when I do coloring work,

795
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:14,038
I want you to work on Cast Shadow first.

796
00:39:14,797 --> 00:39:17,909
It's because if we add light and shade from the weaker areas,

797
00:39:17,934 --> 00:39:19,414
not only does it take a long time,

798
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:22,238
the contrast gets stronger when you're coloring.

799
00:39:22,704 --> 00:39:24,213
I'm sure there's people who do it like that.

800
00:39:24,572 --> 00:39:27,112
The more light and shadow you give, the darker the illustration becomes.

801
00:39:27,383 --> 00:39:28,639
Or, the illustration could become completely white.

802
00:39:28,813 --> 00:39:31,010
I'm sure there are people who have that kind of problem.

803
00:39:31,201 --> 00:39:33,212
In that case, most of the time, in the process itself,

804
00:39:34,194 --> 00:39:36,583
there are times when it gets stronger

805
00:39:37,215 --> 00:39:38,968
than what you intended

806
00:39:38,993 --> 00:39:40,414
as you're giving that kind of light.

807
00:39:40,439 --> 00:39:42,678
To minimize such problems,

808
00:39:42,703 --> 00:39:44,504
let's say I applied Cast Shadow first.

809
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:47,745
The Cast Shadow is darker than the Form Shadow.

810
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:49,964
So, Form Shadow.

811
00:39:50,005 --> 00:39:53,204
It's formed after the Cast Shadow,

812
00:39:53,385 --> 00:39:55,301
and at least it's brighter than Cast Shadow.

813
00:39:55,778 --> 00:39:57,623
So, you can make it brighter, then that's all.

814
00:39:58,811 --> 00:40:00,508
Then the drawing won't 'burn'.

815
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:03,671
Compared to the Cast Shadow that I applied at first,

816
00:40:03,672 --> 00:40:05,128
it won't get dark.

817
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:07,318
So it's much easier to control it.

818
00:40:07,395 --> 00:40:10,408
So, when you're coloring,

819
00:40:10,433 --> 00:40:13,060
it'll be easier to work on it

820
00:40:13,085 --> 00:40:15,123
if you think of

821
00:40:15,148 --> 00:40:16,931
applying the shadows around the objects first.

822
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:39,723
I'll continue to work on the shadows.

823
00:40:46,394 --> 00:40:48,798
The second reason why I work on Cast Shadow first,

824
00:40:48,823 --> 00:40:49,949
is because it can be easily forgotten.

825
00:40:51,676 --> 00:40:54,263
People make a lot of mistakes

826
00:40:54,264 --> 00:40:56,462
by not drawing shadows

827
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:57,971
even when it's an area where shadows can be formed.

828
00:40:57,996 --> 00:40:59,686
Especially, people forget Cast Shadows.

829
00:40:59,993 --> 00:41:02,992
So, I do this first so that I won't forget.

830
00:41:07,284 --> 00:41:09,679
You'll forget a lot from now on, too.

831
00:41:10,205 --> 00:41:13,802
So I worked on it first so that I wouldn't forget it.

832
00:41:13,896 --> 00:41:15,732
You need to keep paying attention to these things.

833
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,453
I'll color the object at the back

834
00:41:38,591 --> 00:41:41,411
a bit darker.

835
00:41:41,884 --> 00:41:44,190
Remember these cracks

836
00:41:45,383 --> 00:41:47,126
that weren't expressed when I applied the base colors?

837
00:41:47,698 --> 00:41:50,795
Let's add a little bit of these at this stage.

838
00:42:03,594 --> 00:42:06,309
It's starting to look like an illustration.

839
00:42:11,623 --> 00:42:13,168
To be honest, even if I just do this,

840
00:42:13,169 --> 00:42:15,420
I can create simple illustrations.

841
00:42:15,602 --> 00:42:18,122
From now on, we're going to

842
00:42:18,124 --> 00:42:19,410
strengthen the nuance of the illustration.

843
00:42:26,909 --> 00:42:29,231
I'm going to make this character cute,

844
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:33,003
and make it calm as well.

845
00:42:35,707 --> 00:42:38,606
I'm also going to make it strong and scary.

846
00:42:40,668 --> 00:42:42,225
Let's have fun.

847
00:42:44,102 --> 00:42:47,192
In the end, this process is about playing with your drawings.

848
00:42:48,076 --> 00:42:50,105
I'm going to play with it in various ways.

849
00:42:50,178 --> 00:42:53,661
As I do so, I'm going to tell you

850
00:42:53,686 --> 00:42:54,810
what's important.

851
00:42:55,185 --> 00:42:57,820
So, you can apply it

852
00:42:57,821 --> 00:42:59,460
to the illustrations you draw

853
00:42:59,462 --> 00:43:00,690
as you are aware of these things.

854
00:43:01,017 --> 00:43:04,507
If you draw it cutely, you need to strengthen the cute side.

855
00:43:04,991 --> 00:43:08,002
For those who want to draw calmly, strengthen the calm aspects.

856
00:43:09,699 --> 00:43:12,187
It's important to proceed

857
00:43:12,989 --> 00:43:15,520
according to your intentions.

858
00:43:17,203 --> 00:43:19,842
Now that the light and shadow are in place,

859
00:43:19,843 --> 00:43:21,311
let's change the color.

860
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,397
I'll use the Lasso Tool

861
00:43:23,504 --> 00:43:25,312
to make this side brighter.

862
00:43:26,514 --> 00:43:28,942
There's a part in the middle that receives strong light, right?

863
00:43:31,806 --> 00:43:33,321
I'll brighten it up like this.

864
00:43:33,712 --> 00:43:35,999
I think there is an overall strong reddish color.

865
00:43:36,024 --> 00:43:37,608
But, I want to add more bluish colors.

866
00:43:38,496 --> 00:43:41,422
I'll use the Color Balance tool to add more blues.

867
00:44:13,996 --> 00:44:16,770
I'm going to use the tools that I mentioned.

868
00:44:16,771 --> 00:44:18,511
And I'll use the Lasso Tool.

869
00:44:18,536 --> 00:44:20,026
This Lasso Tool is very useful.

870
00:44:20,051 --> 00:44:21,789
The biggest advantage of this Lasso Tool is

871
00:44:21,814 --> 00:44:23,723
it doesn't get affected by the Brush Tool.

872
00:44:24,182 --> 00:44:26,467
Whether I draw well or not,

873
00:44:26,492 --> 00:44:29,074
or whether I draw with a mouse or a tablet,

874
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:31,044
the Lasso Tool has the same results.

875
00:44:31,491 --> 00:44:34,604
So as long as you get used to it,

876
00:44:34,629 --> 00:44:36,732
even for those who are not used to coloring,

877
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:38,301
you'll get used to it soon.

878
00:44:38,326 --> 00:44:41,737
For those who are not used to coloring or tablets,

879
00:44:41,999 --> 00:44:43,660
especially if you're not used to tablets,

880
00:44:43,685 --> 00:44:44,987
I think it would be good to

881
00:44:45,012 --> 00:44:48,873
do the early work process like this.

882
00:44:48,898 --> 00:44:51,605
If you just use it a few times,

883
00:44:51,607 --> 00:44:54,287
you'll get used to it quickly.

884
00:44:57,006 --> 00:44:58,410
You'll know if you try it yourself.

885
00:44:58,412 --> 00:44:59,625
It's simpler than you think.

886
00:44:59,626 --> 00:45:00,816
If you use the Lasso Tool,

887
00:45:00,841 --> 00:45:03,084
you can just select the areas you want to apply the light and shadow

888
00:45:03,109 --> 00:45:04,884
and apply as much as you want.

889
00:45:10,778 --> 00:45:14,179
So, we learned how to rough in colors

890
00:45:14,204 --> 00:45:15,302
today.

891
00:45:15,303 --> 00:45:16,871
Now, let's

892
00:45:16,904 --> 00:45:18,238
talk about the lighting.

893
00:45:18,238 --> 00:45:20,072
We'll go over this briefly.

894
00:45:20,089 --> 00:45:21,509
What's important in the lighting process?

895
00:45:21,511 --> 00:45:24,216
We're going to take time learning more about light.

896
00:45:24,241 --> 00:45:26,394
What is light?

897
00:45:26,504 --> 00:45:29,574
When we studied lighting last time,

898
00:45:29,574 --> 00:45:31,709
I'm sure I told you what it is.

899
00:45:31,833 --> 00:45:33,895
And when I was doing the illustration earlier,

900
00:45:33,896 --> 00:45:36,185
I told you that it is important to

901
00:45:36,186 --> 00:45:38,238
realize the four aspects of light

902
00:45:38,263 --> 00:45:40,015
before you start working.

903
00:45:40,273 --> 00:45:42,914
And there's one more thing we need to choose.

904
00:45:42,915 --> 00:45:44,835
Soft Light and Hard Light.

905
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:47,898
Why are they so important?

906
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,968
It's because of the amount of information.

907
00:45:51,103 --> 00:45:54,329
You need to know what Soft Light and Hard Light is.

908
00:45:54,909 --> 00:45:56,562
What is Soft Light?

909
00:45:56,563 --> 00:45:59,508
Soft light is a light that spreads smoothly, literally.

910
00:45:59,996 --> 00:46:01,672
It's a light that spreads smoothly,

911
00:46:01,674 --> 00:46:03,924
so there's a gradation with the light and shadow.

912
00:46:04,221 --> 00:46:06,899
So, they will be layered.

913
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:11,644
That means there's a lot of information about light and shadow.

914
00:46:11,645 --> 00:46:13,017
The fact that there's a lot of gradation

915
00:46:13,377 --> 00:46:15,591
means that there is a lot of information.

916
00:46:16,074 --> 00:46:19,813
So when we're done,

917
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:23,015
the illustration will have density.

918
00:46:23,505 --> 00:46:24,845
On the contrary, the downside is

919
00:46:24,846 --> 00:46:26,680
that the illustration can have too much information.

920
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:30,423
If you use Soft Light for a character with a complicated design,

921
00:46:31,691 --> 00:46:35,006
you might not see its design well.

922
00:46:35,008 --> 00:46:36,428
That's the problem.

923
00:46:36,675 --> 00:46:38,089
On the other hand, Hard Light

924
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:41,158
gives a clean contrast between objects.

925
00:46:41,422 --> 00:46:43,941
Compared to the Soft Light that I mentioned earlier,

926
00:46:43,942 --> 00:46:45,696
it gives a different vibe.

927
00:46:45,721 --> 00:46:49,095
It looks bright and strong, so you can see it clearly.

928
00:46:49,198 --> 00:46:50,712
But as the shadows don't spread smoothly,

929
00:46:50,737 --> 00:46:52,679
the amount of information can be a little small.

930
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:55,171
But it's a slightly different scenario.

931
00:46:55,196 --> 00:46:56,410
Let's take a look.

932
00:46:56,435 --> 00:46:58,684
This illustration is an example of Hard Light.

933
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:01,212
Like I said before, when there's a lot of information,

934
00:47:01,237 --> 00:47:02,620
let's say there's the background,

935
00:47:02,621 --> 00:47:05,404
a chameleon, the main character, and some small things.

936
00:47:05,429 --> 00:47:07,065
In a situation where there's a lot of objects,

937
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:08,700
if you use Hard Light,

938
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:11,437
since the light and shadow areas are neatly separated,

939
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,996
when you look at it at first glance, it gives you a very comfortable feeling.

940
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:17,293
I think a scene from an animation would be a good example.

941
00:47:17,399 --> 00:47:19,505
An animation has simple characters,

942
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:21,210
but complicated backgrounds.

943
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,731
So compared to the background, the character

944
00:47:23,756 --> 00:47:26,125
is just drawn in simply.

945
00:47:26,226 --> 00:47:28,825
You'll be able to see the illustration clearly.

946
00:47:28,965 --> 00:47:30,189
Then, I'll share another scenario.

947
00:47:32,102 --> 00:47:34,108
This is an example of using Soft Light.

948
00:47:34,293 --> 00:47:35,863
When there are relatively few elements,

949
00:47:35,888 --> 00:47:38,233
to make people more focused,

950
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,678
using Soft Light is the best.

951
00:47:39,818 --> 00:47:42,519
It feels like the light is spreading out smoothly.

952
00:47:42,596 --> 00:47:46,100
So, you can draw attention to the center.

953
00:47:46,773 --> 00:47:50,880
This illustration has a lot of elements and there's Soft Light applied.

954
00:47:50,881 --> 00:47:53,076
So, this illustration has a lot of information.

955
00:47:53,077 --> 00:47:55,819
There's a lot of information already, but it's doubled.

956
00:47:55,904 --> 00:47:59,275
So, this illustration will have tons of information.

957
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:01,953
That's how I approached it, so I worked on it like that.

958
00:48:02,684 --> 00:48:05,225
But, if you want to draw a simple illustration,

959
00:48:05,496 --> 00:48:08,090
such as a casual-style illustration,

960
00:48:08,091 --> 00:48:09,824
and you don't want to draw a sophisticated design,

961
00:48:10,198 --> 00:48:12,790
then the character would look too bland.

962
00:48:12,903 --> 00:48:15,602
In that case, we can apply Soft Light.

963
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:18,019
That's more effective.

964
00:48:18,899 --> 00:48:22,103
But let's say your illustration's design is complicated.

965
00:48:22,809 --> 00:48:25,827
You might think it will get too complicated if you use Soft Light.

966
00:48:25,828 --> 00:48:26,832
In that case,

967
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:29,192
you can apply Hard Light like you did before.

968
00:48:29,672 --> 00:48:32,904
But there's another way to use this Hard Light.

969
00:48:33,388 --> 00:48:35,998
If you use Hard Light like this,

970
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,618
as I said before, you should draw it simply.

971
00:48:38,885 --> 00:48:41,117
But there's another example for using this Hard Light.

972
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:42,399
What is it?

973
00:48:43,315 --> 00:48:45,599
It's the dark areas.

974
00:48:46,218 --> 00:48:49,815
The dark areas are literally where the shadows come in.

975
00:48:50,242 --> 00:48:52,910
Depending on how much it's darkened,

976
00:48:52,911 --> 00:48:55,211
what I just said could be reversed.

977
00:49:02,096 --> 00:49:04,351
For example, let's say I applied lighting like this

978
00:49:04,352 --> 00:49:05,743
to this illustration.

979
00:49:43,316 --> 00:49:44,339
What do you think?

980
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:46,950
I definitely used Hard Light.

981
00:49:46,951 --> 00:49:50,048
But compared to other examples of Soft Light,

982
00:49:50,073 --> 00:49:51,888
doesn't it have a stronger impression?

983
00:49:53,598 --> 00:49:54,857
The reason why it has a strong impression is

984
00:49:54,882 --> 00:49:57,999
because the amount of shadow and light are at a 5:5 ratio.

985
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:01,818
So, there's half light areas, and half dark areas,

986
00:50:01,843 --> 00:50:04,002
and that's why it looks very complicated.

987
00:50:04,027 --> 00:50:05,995
So, our eyes will get confused.

988
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:07,814
That's why it's good to use these lights

989
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:11,817
when the design is simple.

990
00:50:11,877 --> 00:50:15,116
When you want to give a strong impression while keeping the design simple,

991
00:50:15,709 --> 00:50:17,513
and when you want to apply Hard Light,

992
00:50:17,538 --> 00:50:20,131
or when you want to color it neatly,

993
00:50:20,333 --> 00:50:23,115
then, you should widen the areas

994
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:25,397
of the light parts and the dark parts.

995
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:27,203
Hard Light gives more information to

996
00:50:27,228 --> 00:50:28,990
the parts that look neat,

997
00:50:29,896 --> 00:50:32,975
in other words,

998
00:50:33,993 --> 00:50:35,759
the parts that have little information.

999
00:50:36,405 --> 00:50:39,453
Then, is it good to have a wide dark area?

1000
00:50:39,891 --> 00:50:44,629
And if the shadow is wide,

1001
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:45,861
you may think the illustration will be complicated.

1002
00:50:45,862 --> 00:50:47,167
Actually, that's not true.

1003
00:50:51,205 --> 00:50:52,823
I mentioned the proportion before.

1004
00:50:59,525 --> 00:51:03,040
In the case of illustration with a lot of dark areas and there's a bit of light,

1005
00:51:03,065 --> 00:51:04,501
it works the opposite way.

1006
00:51:04,926 --> 00:51:06,048
On the contrary, it becomes neat.

1007
00:51:06,073 --> 00:51:08,530
It's just an overall dark and calm illustration.

1008
00:51:10,193 --> 00:51:11,502
So the important thing is the proportion.

1009
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:16,243
It looks a lot calmer than the 5:5 light we applied in the previous one.

1010
00:51:16,268 --> 00:51:17,432
If we apply it like this,

1011
00:51:22,314 --> 00:51:23,827
the overall image,

1012
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:26,586
compared to the previous illustration,

1013
00:51:27,177 --> 00:51:29,497
becomes a little more calm.

1014
00:51:29,988 --> 00:51:32,221
So, during the lighting process,

1015
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:36,735
adjust the amount of darkness

1016
00:51:36,737 --> 00:51:37,768
according to the mood you want.

1017
00:51:37,769 --> 00:51:40,298
You'll be able to do the coloring more easily.

1018
00:51:41,198 --> 00:51:45,564
If you want to give it a simple mood,

1019
00:51:45,589 --> 00:51:47,106
or if you want to give it a light mood,

1020
00:51:47,107 --> 00:51:50,216
then like this, add 3 shades of light and shade.

1021
00:51:50,877 --> 00:51:52,982
If you want to give

1022
00:51:53,007 --> 00:51:54,408
a strong impression,

1023
00:51:54,606 --> 00:51:55,699
then adjust it to 5:5.

1024
00:51:56,907 --> 00:51:59,104
If you want to make it simple,

1025
00:51:59,104 --> 00:52:02,417
but you want to maintain some weight at the same time.

1026
00:52:02,781 --> 00:52:04,621
Then add less light like this,

1027
00:52:05,661 --> 00:52:07,266
and by using it depending on the situation,

1028
00:52:07,275 --> 00:52:09,826
you will be able to get the mood you want easily.

1029
00:52:10,009 --> 00:52:13,974
Of course, when we do this in different moods,

1030
00:52:14,116 --> 00:52:18,212
we're going to talk more about that character's work.

1031
00:52:18,792 --> 00:52:21,416
Let's talk about it once again by that time.

1032
00:52:28,502 --> 00:52:31,505
If you use a soft light form,

1033
00:52:33,295 --> 00:52:34,354
like this,

1034
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:48,798
you can use it according to the situation.

1035
00:52:52,784 --> 00:52:54,219
First of all, today

1036
00:52:56,188 --> 00:52:57,552
we went through the lighting

1037
00:53:01,006 --> 00:53:03,745
and the roughing in color.

1038
00:53:04,887 --> 00:53:06,526
At this point,

1039
00:53:06,527 --> 00:53:08,550
this character looks a bit intense.

1040
00:53:09,528 --> 00:53:12,543
To make it clear, I'll make the line brighter.

1041
00:53:20,811 --> 00:53:22,991
If you make the line brighter,

1042
00:53:27,783 --> 00:53:29,096
the overall impression

1043
00:53:29,121 --> 00:53:31,362
changes to fit

1044
00:53:32,921 --> 00:53:35,296
the intense image.

1045
00:53:35,328 --> 00:53:38,627
We're going to change the nuance of this one.

1046
00:53:40,214 --> 00:53:41,845
I'm sure you are going to enjoy it.

1047
00:53:41,846 --> 00:53:43,335
It's the part that I wanted to show the most

1048
00:53:43,336 --> 00:53:45,504
in this lecture.

1049
00:53:45,505 --> 00:53:46,992
So let's work on it,

1050
00:53:47,017 --> 00:53:48,596
from the next lecture.

1051
00:53:49,228 --> 00:53:52,911
Then, I will end today's class here.

1052
00:53:53,182 --> 00:53:54,315
Thank you for your attention.
