00:00:06,211 --> 00:00:07,250
Hello.

3
00:00:07,726 --> 00:00:11,028
Let's start Chapter 4, 'Understanding Movements Based on Human Anatomy Simplification'.

4
00:00:11,426 --> 00:00:15,636
Last time, we went over the proportions of the human body.

5
00:00:15,661 --> 00:00:17,294
Now that you've learned proportions,

6
00:00:17,319 --> 00:00:22,052
you can now draw the human body

7
00:00:22,077 --> 00:00:25,712
so that it looks solid to some extent, not flat.

8
00:00:25,919 --> 00:00:28,575
Let me draw an example.

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,075
For the detailed outlines,

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:42,044
I recommend you study on your own

11
00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:46,036
the things you need to practice

12
00:00:46,061 --> 00:00:47,747
by looking at photo references and anatomy resources on the Internet.

13
00:00:47,772 --> 00:00:50,058
You can also read books to study.

14
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,817
Like I mentioned before,

15
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:54,442
even if I don't draw extra lines,

16
00:00:54,467 --> 00:00:57,778
it won't be a big problem

17
00:00:57,803 --> 00:00:59,474
since the character is going to have clothes later on.

18
00:00:59,599 --> 00:01:02,911
For now, I hope that you

19
00:01:02,936 --> 00:01:04,199
are able to at least

20
00:01:04,224 --> 00:01:07,310
draw the basic form of the body.

21
00:01:07,989 --> 00:01:09,724
That's all that is needed for now.

22
00:01:09,927 --> 00:01:11,997
If you can draw that,

23
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,739
you'll have no problem taking this course.

24
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:20,380
As long as that isn't too difficult to draw,

25
00:01:20,405 --> 00:01:21,278
it won't be a problem.

26
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,231
And of course, it's okay

27
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:27,528
even if drawing this is a bit difficult for now.

28
00:01:28,028 --> 00:01:30,317
I'll go over today's lecture

29
00:01:30,614 --> 00:01:32,816
in a way that is easy to follow.

30
00:01:32,841 --> 00:01:34,556
In the previous lecture, I drew a mannequin

31
00:01:34,558 --> 00:01:37,210
just like this.

32
00:01:37,235 --> 00:01:40,224
Today, we're going to learn

33
00:01:40,249 --> 00:01:41,755
how to move this mannequin.

34
00:01:42,513 --> 00:01:44,325
Now, it's important to be able

35
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:47,497
to draw a character's pose any way you want

36
00:01:47,522 --> 00:01:48,333
after learning how to move this mannequin.

37
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,833
Previously, I went over the three elements of the human body,

38
00:01:50,858 --> 00:01:59,122
which are movements, proportions, and lines.

39
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:03,052
Today, I'll go over the movements.

40
00:02:03,231 --> 00:02:04,769
Personally, I think this element

41
00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:07,128
is the most important one.

42
00:02:07,153 --> 00:02:10,106
As I mentioned before, your illustration will look good

43
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:11,512
if the pose is described naturally.

44
00:02:11,514 --> 00:02:13,880
So, let me tell you

45
00:02:13,905 --> 00:02:15,425
what this movement is all about.

46
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,669
You might have heard

47
00:02:17,694 --> 00:02:18,902
things like this:

48
00:02:18,904 --> 00:02:21,367
When a shoulder is raised upwards,

49
00:02:21,369 --> 00:02:23,333
or when it is pushed forwards,

50
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,377
naturally, the pelvis on the opposite side is raised upwards.

51
00:02:28,747 --> 00:02:31,958
Or, the pelvis on the same side goes downwards.

52
00:02:32,114 --> 00:02:33,817
Anatomy theories like this,

53
00:02:34,707 --> 00:02:44,823
they are commonly referred to as contrapposto.

54
00:02:44,848 --> 00:02:48,451
Nevertheless, you don't have to always follow them.

55
00:02:48,453 --> 00:02:51,002
In real life, even if it's a bit awkward, you might sometimes walk

56
00:02:51,027 --> 00:02:54,385
with your left foot and hand stretched forwards together.

57
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:57,049
So, this contrapposto,

58
00:02:57,074 --> 00:02:59,394
isn't always strictly applied to all poses.

59
00:02:59,396 --> 00:03:02,034
A contrapposto is a guideline when a character does a certain pose

60
00:03:02,059 --> 00:03:04,151
they would look more comfortable

61
00:03:04,323 --> 00:03:06,690
and their anatomy would look more natural.

62
00:03:06,715 --> 00:03:08,824
Thus, even if we don't apply the contrapposto,

63
00:03:08,826 --> 00:03:11,346
we can still draw the poses.

64
00:03:11,371 --> 00:03:12,877
However, if we do so,

65
00:03:12,902 --> 00:03:16,010
the illustration would look very awkward.

66
00:03:16,035 --> 00:03:17,729
So we don't do that often when we actually draw.

67
00:03:17,754 --> 00:03:20,799
Just keep that in mind.

68
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,979
Sometimes, when you're drawing,

69
00:03:22,981 --> 00:03:25,276
you might actually pose the same as the character

70
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:27,462
and take a picture of yourself.

71
00:03:27,487 --> 00:03:30,563
Or, you might try to capture the posing in all the different angles

72
00:03:30,588 --> 00:03:32,639
and check if the poses

73
00:03:32,641 --> 00:03:34,399
are physically correct or not.

74
00:03:34,424 --> 00:03:36,143
Now, when you're doing that, the standard would be

75
00:03:36,168 --> 00:03:38,323
whether you feel comfortable in the pose or not.

76
00:03:38,348 --> 00:03:40,956
And that would be it

77
00:03:40,981 --> 00:03:42,510
for the theories regarding contrapposto.

78
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,532
When a shoulder is raised upwards,

79
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,440
the pelvis on the same side goes downwards.

80
00:03:46,674 --> 00:03:49,104
And when a shoulder is pushed forwards,

81
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,351
like this,

82
00:03:51,376 --> 00:03:52,713
when we look at it from upwards,

83
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,698
the pelvis on the opposite side moves forwards,

84
00:03:57,417 --> 00:03:58,167
like this.

85
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,924
This is all you need to know

86
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:04,501
when you draw movements.

87
00:04:04,526 --> 00:04:08,292
And it is the best

88
00:04:08,317 --> 00:04:09,112
to learn while actually drawing.

89
00:04:09,137 --> 00:04:12,221
It is important to move the mannequin in your head

90
00:04:12,246 --> 00:04:15,432
and you need to be used to it.

91
00:04:16,002 --> 00:04:19,042
But even if it is a simple mannequin,

92
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:21,198
like the one we looked at last time

93
00:04:21,223 --> 00:04:24,432
it is still hard to move it in your head.

94
00:04:24,721 --> 00:04:25,915
This is why

95
00:04:25,917 --> 00:04:28,165
we have to go through one more process,

96
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:30,352
and that would be the simplification process.

97
00:04:35,948 --> 00:04:40,936
The simplification process would literally be

98
00:04:40,961 --> 00:04:41,992
making the character easier to draw.

99
00:04:42,102 --> 00:04:45,014
Or, the same term is used

100
00:04:45,016 --> 00:04:46,297
when we make the character easier to imagine.

101
00:04:47,164 --> 00:04:48,335
It might seem out of the blue,

102
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,071
but I really like drawings done by animators.

103
00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:56,860
Because of their jobs,

104
00:04:56,885 --> 00:05:00,117
at maximum, they draw over 100 pieces a day.

105
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,414
To draw over 100 pieces, you'll need to draw a lot,

106
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:05,141
and when something goes wrong while drawing,

107
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,797
the final movement would look awkward.

108
00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:11,953
So when you look at the rough drafts drawn by animators,

109
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,227
in other words, the simplified drawings,

110
00:05:15,252 --> 00:05:17,877
they have very accurate proportions.

111
00:05:18,078 --> 00:05:20,133
You can see a lot of the details are excluded here.

112
00:05:20,158 --> 00:05:21,999
If you see the lines,

113
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:24,943
you can see they have a very simple form.

114
00:05:24,945 --> 00:05:26,977
Even with clothes, they could be simplified

115
00:05:27,002 --> 00:05:28,516
and be drawn like this.

116
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:31,171
Some of you might have seen

117
00:05:31,173 --> 00:05:32,992
the original drawings done by animators.

118
00:05:34,086 --> 00:05:35,813
If you've seen those,

119
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:37,696
you would have felt they were simplified.

120
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:39,407
A lot of the details are simplified

121
00:05:39,432 --> 00:05:41,071
and a lot of things are left out.

122
00:05:41,096 --> 00:05:42,499
Actually, right here,

123
00:05:42,524 --> 00:05:44,969
the proportions that we learned previously

124
00:05:44,994 --> 00:05:46,407
are all applied to the drawing.

125
00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:48,040
And this information

126
00:05:48,042 --> 00:05:49,624
is applied quite accurately.

127
00:05:49,649 --> 00:06:03,524
Because an animator's rough drafts are

128
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:08,703
done rapidly and accurately,

129
00:06:08,728 --> 00:06:10,532
you'll get the feeling that their drawing is stabilized.

130
00:06:10,836 --> 00:06:14,297
If these animators pick up a trendier drawing style

131
00:06:14,322 --> 00:06:16,382
or a coloring style,

132
00:06:16,407 --> 00:06:20,016
a lot of them become

133
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:21,273
really popular in the field.

134
00:06:21,275 --> 00:06:25,006
For instance, works done by Japanese animators,

135
00:06:25,008 --> 00:06:26,551
like Mai Yoneyama,

136
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:27,828
or Hongkkiii -

137
00:06:28,016 --> 00:06:29,739
if you look at works done by illustrators

138
00:06:29,763 --> 00:06:31,297
who were originally animators,

139
00:06:31,322 --> 00:06:34,399
you can really see that they have grasped the basics well.

140
00:06:35,586 --> 00:06:37,875
Previously, I mentioned that

141
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,175
accuracy and speed are important in the rough draft.

142
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:42,833
Obviously, you'll know why accuracy is important.

143
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:45,522
If you get the proportions wrong, you'll have to fix them later.

144
00:06:45,547 --> 00:06:47,180
So you need to be accurate.

145
00:06:47,205 --> 00:06:49,438
Then why would you need to draw quickly?

146
00:06:49,578 --> 00:06:51,928
I'll tell you the reason why

147
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:52,914
you need to draw quickly.

148
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:56,750
It's related to the reason we use simplification.

149
00:06:57,149 --> 00:06:58,649
So, the reason we need to sketch our rough drafts quickly,

150
00:06:58,674 --> 00:07:01,946
is because when we remember an image,

151
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:08,582
we aren't given that much time.

152
00:07:08,584 --> 00:07:11,783
Actually, when we imagine something in our head,

153
00:07:11,785 --> 00:07:16,756
I believe 15 seconds is the maximum we can remember it.

154
00:07:16,758 --> 00:07:19,347
When we go past that, the image in our head

155
00:07:19,349 --> 00:07:20,828
starts to become blurry.

156
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,907
So it's a very brief time.

157
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:27,078
Then, as soon as you go past 15 seconds,

158
00:07:27,103 --> 00:07:29,086
what you imagined and what you draw

159
00:07:29,111 --> 00:07:30,946
will be more and more different as time passes,

160
00:07:30,971 --> 00:07:33,770
so you need to keep adjusting

161
00:07:33,772 --> 00:07:35,109
what you are drawing on the canvas

162
00:07:35,111 --> 00:07:36,971
so that it becomes similar to what you imagined.

163
00:07:37,149 --> 00:07:40,131
To minimize such adjustments,

164
00:07:40,133 --> 00:07:43,897
it is good if you have the skills

165
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:48,391
to draw what you have imagined

166
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:50,672
within a 15-30 second timeframe.

167
00:07:50,836 --> 00:07:53,711
Then you can draw what you've imagined at once.

168
00:07:55,414 --> 00:07:58,953
I've talked about simplification so far.

169
00:07:59,172 --> 00:08:01,602
In this process, it is important

170
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,972
to accurately and quickly do your sketches.

171
00:08:03,974 --> 00:08:05,844
The key point of today's class would

172
00:08:05,869 --> 00:08:10,094
focus on quickly and accurately drawing

173
00:08:10,119 --> 00:08:13,063
what you've imagined in your head.

174
00:08:13,088 --> 00:08:15,833
From now on, we'll focus on the actual exercises.

175
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,203
From now on, I'll focus on

176
00:08:17,228 --> 00:08:19,275
mostly explaining

177
00:08:19,277 --> 00:08:21,131
as I actually draw.

178
00:08:23,672 --> 00:08:26,435
But first, before I go into this topic, I'd like to mention

179
00:08:26,437 --> 00:08:29,821
that everyone has their own simplification style.

180
00:08:29,946 --> 00:08:32,117
Some of you might think that the human body I drew

181
00:08:32,142 --> 00:08:35,019
in the previous class is a simplification on its own.

182
00:08:35,172 --> 00:08:39,852
Some of you might simplify even more

183
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:41,875
and draw a mannequin

184
00:08:42,641 --> 00:08:47,781
like this

185
00:08:47,806 --> 00:08:50,086
because you don't have the time to draw everything.

186
00:08:51,852 --> 00:08:53,608
And some of you might draw a line

187
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:56,800
for the limbs because of the time limit.

188
00:08:57,672 --> 00:09:00,548
Some of you might want to add the volumes

189
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,375
and think drawing lines is inappropriate for this.

190
00:09:02,377 --> 00:09:05,539
So, you might draw them in cylinders.

191
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,188
So the simplification process has no answer.

192
00:09:08,212 --> 00:09:10,420
It just has to feel right to you.

193
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:13,303
For those of you already familiar with human anatomy,

194
00:09:13,328 --> 00:09:16,336
I'm sure most of you draw the details beforehand

195
00:09:16,361 --> 00:09:19,383
in the rough draft stage.

196
00:09:20,104 --> 00:09:22,797
But in order to do that,

197
00:09:22,822 --> 00:09:24,985
you need to be experienced in drawing.

198
00:09:25,821 --> 00:09:28,383
And before you have enough experience to do that,

199
00:09:28,408 --> 00:09:30,102
you should simplify as much as you can

200
00:09:30,406 --> 00:09:32,453
and make sure you draw with ease.

201
00:09:32,883 --> 00:09:35,078
In other words, there's no answer to the simplification process.

202
00:09:35,103 --> 00:09:38,211
It is important to find a simplification method

203
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,978
where you are the most comfortable

204
00:09:41,979 --> 00:09:44,461
and where you feel there won't be problems with your further work.

205
00:09:44,486 --> 00:09:48,203
For the pelvis, there are some of you

206
00:09:48,204 --> 00:09:51,061
who describe it as a Frisbee that is folded it half.

207
00:09:51,086 --> 00:09:52,453
And some of you might

208
00:09:52,478 --> 00:09:55,242
describe it as an underwear.

209
00:09:55,414 --> 00:09:56,638
And others might

210
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,438
just draw a trapezoid

211
00:09:58,463 --> 00:10:00,531
and attach the legs to it.

212
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:02,406
There are many ways to do it.

213
00:10:02,431 --> 00:10:05,274
However, as you simplify your drawings,

214
00:10:05,299 --> 00:10:06,953
and as it becomes distorted and becomes different

215
00:10:07,121 --> 00:10:08,701
from the actual human anatomy

216
00:10:08,703 --> 00:10:10,828
the accuracy of your drawing will decrease.

217
00:10:11,133 --> 00:10:12,727
But, with these inaccuracies,

218
00:10:12,728 --> 00:10:14,827
you can edit them later

219
00:10:14,852 --> 00:10:16,424
as you draw in the later stages.

220
00:10:19,844 --> 00:10:22,164
Let me demonstrate this with an exercise.

221
00:10:22,672 --> 00:10:24,703
On the left, you'll see a photo reference.

222
00:10:24,728 --> 00:10:27,328
When you are studying movements,

223
00:10:27,353 --> 00:10:30,145
you might commonly use photo references.

224
00:10:30,844 --> 00:10:33,688
In this stage, we'll apply what we've learned in Chapter 2

225
00:10:33,713 --> 00:10:35,274
and analyze the material

226
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:36,696
step by step.

227
00:10:37,438 --> 00:10:39,883
We're not focusing on the coloring today.

228
00:10:39,908 --> 00:10:42,280
Instead, we're focusing on the drawing.

229
00:10:42,305 --> 00:10:45,227
I'll lower the opacity a bit.

230
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:51,225
Now, the first thing I recommend you to do

231
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,196
is when you observe the movement while looking at a photo reference

232
00:10:53,221 --> 00:10:55,899
is to analyze it and draw.

233
00:10:57,485 --> 00:10:59,086
Let's start with the head.

234
00:11:00,289 --> 00:11:02,125
As you trace along like this,

235
00:11:04,711 --> 00:11:07,586
you need to know exactly

236
00:11:07,611 --> 00:11:08,914
how the image is composed.

237
00:11:08,939 --> 00:11:11,433
At first, even doing this is very difficult.

238
00:11:12,617 --> 00:11:14,672
Accurately analyzing a photo

239
00:11:14,697 --> 00:11:16,758
requires some skill.

240
00:11:16,946 --> 00:11:17,889
This is why

241
00:11:17,914 --> 00:11:20,633
you shouldn't skip this step.

242
00:11:20,658 --> 00:11:24,625
When copying or drawing croquis while looking at photos,

243
00:11:25,696 --> 00:11:27,094
most students make the mistake of

244
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,113
skipping this part.

245
00:11:29,115 --> 00:11:30,796
However, I truly believe that

246
00:11:30,821 --> 00:11:33,281
this process is really helpful.

247
00:11:33,531 --> 00:11:34,946
Now, if you look here,

248
00:11:34,971 --> 00:11:37,414
the collarbone sticks out like this.

249
00:11:38,608 --> 00:11:42,953
As you can see, the ribs will pass through the center of the chest.

250
00:11:44,188 --> 00:11:46,711
You can also see how the upper body is generally moving.

251
00:11:46,736 --> 00:11:48,805
We won't look at the arms for now.

252
00:11:50,789 --> 00:11:54,383
Now, when I mention the shoulder area,

253
00:11:54,408 --> 00:11:58,781
the area includes the back muscles and the scapula.

254
00:11:58,806 --> 00:11:59,860
In other words,

255
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,047
the ribs would go up to here,

256
00:12:02,469 --> 00:12:05,766
and you can consider one third of the rear

257
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,223
as the back.

258
00:12:08,688 --> 00:12:14,492
Here, the muscles are attached to the back, such as the scapula

259
00:12:14,517 --> 00:12:15,927
and the latissimus dorsi muscle.

260
00:12:16,477 --> 00:12:17,358
That's all.

261
00:12:17,383 --> 00:12:19,164
Check where the belly button is located

262
00:12:19,774 --> 00:12:22,180
and think of the proportions we went over last time.

263
00:12:22,205 --> 00:12:23,313
1:1, remember?

264
00:12:23,338 --> 00:12:24,883
The pelvis will stick out right here.

265
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:27,211
Let me draw like this.

266
00:12:32,697 --> 00:12:35,193
So, you need to take time analyzing the photo material.

267
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,092
The things you should look out for

268
00:12:40,117 --> 00:12:42,701
are the movements,

269
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,184
not the outlines.

270
00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:49,404
That's why you should focus on the overall movement.

271
00:12:50,881 --> 00:12:52,435
Usually, when you draw gestured croquis,

272
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:55,295
you draw in a 15-second timeframe.

273
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,450
With croquis, although I'll emphasize it

274
00:12:57,452 --> 00:12:58,810
once more before this lecture ends,

275
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:04,256
but before you get familiar with

276
00:13:04,281 --> 00:13:06,029
a 15-second croquis,

277
00:13:06,054 --> 00:13:08,474
you must analyze the photo first

278
00:13:08,506 --> 00:13:11,684
then go on to the next step.

279
00:13:11,685 --> 00:13:13,318
Once you've analyzed it,

280
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,153
now it's time to draw.

281
00:13:15,451 --> 00:13:17,982
I'll draw according to

282
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:19,081
the simplification process I thought of.

283
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:20,308
Now, the important thing here is

284
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:24,028
instead of drawing an 8 head figure just like the reference,

285
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:25,791
though it might be a bit difficult,

286
00:13:25,793 --> 00:13:28,295
you should practice according to

287
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,530
the character proportion you're thinking of.

288
00:13:32,701 --> 00:13:35,248
Since I usually draw a 6 or 7 head figure,

289
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,537
I'll simplify according to that proportion.

290
00:13:42,961 --> 00:13:43,995
If it is possible,

291
00:13:43,997 --> 00:13:47,567
if you have a certain order for drawing a human body,

292
00:13:47,592 --> 00:13:50,795
you should draw according to that order.

293
00:13:52,287 --> 00:13:55,084
If you draw the head first, draw the head first.

294
00:13:55,109 --> 00:13:58,771
And if you draw the body first, draw that first.

295
00:14:07,896 --> 00:14:09,189
As for me, when I'm doing the rough draft,

296
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:12,412
I draw some of the outlines as well.

297
00:14:16,138 --> 00:14:18,217
Doing so reduces

298
00:14:18,428 --> 00:14:20,638
the mistakes I might make later on.

299
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,857
I'll add in the shoulder area, like so.

300
00:14:49,386 --> 00:14:50,620
When you're doing the rough draft,

301
00:14:50,622 --> 00:14:53,892
it is important to analyze the general movements.

302
00:14:53,917 --> 00:14:56,230
Here, you might make slight proportional mistakes.

303
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:59,516
Right now, I'm intentionally making

304
00:14:59,517 --> 00:15:00,480
proportional mistakes.

305
00:15:00,505 --> 00:15:02,153
I'll show you the process later on.

306
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,439
I'll finish my rough draft here.

307
00:15:07,792 --> 00:15:09,811
When you have the finished rough draft like this,

308
00:15:09,948 --> 00:15:12,800
now you sketch additional details on top of it.

309
00:15:12,925 --> 00:15:14,339
Now, you see,

310
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:15,815
when you draw,

311
00:15:15,817 --> 00:15:17,808
you don't have to illustrate everything

312
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,011
in a single drawing stage so perfectly.

313
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:22,409
So when you illustrate,

314
00:15:22,434 --> 00:15:25,136
if you feel like you don't have enough basics,

315
00:15:25,161 --> 00:15:28,308
break the process down into many steps.

316
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,878
That will give you room to focus on each step.

317
00:15:33,862 --> 00:15:36,378
Like mentioned before, when you're doing the rough draft,

318
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:40,065
you focus on the general movements.

319
00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:43,748
When you sketch the additional details,

320
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,321
you adjust the proportions.

321
00:15:46,128 --> 00:15:47,875
What's next?

322
00:15:48,003 --> 00:15:50,042
You'll adjust the outlines afterwards.

323
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,048
For example, the muscle outlines or the bone outlines.

324
00:15:52,073 --> 00:15:53,665
If there's something you missed,

325
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,581
you would look at photo references

326
00:15:55,606 --> 00:15:57,276
and describe more outlines in detail.

327
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:00,909
You'll draw the lines after that.

328
00:16:00,934 --> 00:16:02,847
This is actually similar to the outline stage.

329
00:16:04,058 --> 00:16:05,345
As you draw the lines,

330
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,786
you'll check once more

331
00:16:06,787 --> 00:16:08,985
if you drew everything correctly.

332
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,235
Thus, the illustration becomes more perfect

333
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:13,231
as you complete the different stages.

334
00:16:13,401 --> 00:16:15,710
You might ask, if all this would take a lot of time.

335
00:16:15,862 --> 00:16:17,112
Well, to tell you the truth,

336
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,642
it does.

337
00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:21,612
But, as we draw,

338
00:16:21,637 --> 00:16:23,659
and finish a single piece,

339
00:16:23,684 --> 00:16:26,815
people don't consider how much time it took.

340
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,308
They just look at the results.

341
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:31,519
So I believe it's really important to

342
00:16:31,544 --> 00:16:33,276
draw as best as you can, even if it takes a lot of time.

343
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:35,384
So, let's move on

344
00:16:35,409 --> 00:16:37,409
to sketching the additional details.

345
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,511
Like I mentioned before, in this stage,

346
00:16:39,536 --> 00:16:41,103
you'll correct the proportional errors.

347
00:16:41,284 --> 00:16:43,823
I'll fix whatever is difficult to apply

348
00:16:43,848 --> 00:16:46,136
in a casual style drawing in this stage.

349
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:48,416
For example, right here,

350
00:16:48,418 --> 00:16:50,473
most of the neck is hidden.

351
00:16:50,474 --> 00:16:52,166
Of course, it's because of the angle.

352
00:16:52,168 --> 00:16:54,151
But if a casual style character doesn't have a neck,

353
00:16:54,152 --> 00:16:55,925
it could look a bit ugly,

354
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,292
so I'll lift the head a bit.

355
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:06,915
When you're adding the additional sketches,

356
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,480
you should describe some details of the head.

357
00:17:09,581 --> 00:17:12,097
I'll just mark where

358
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,799
the ears, eyes, mouth and nose will be located.

359
00:17:14,831 --> 00:17:19,909
The next lecture will thoroughly cover the face.

360
00:17:19,934 --> 00:17:21,917
So, I'll go over drawing the face

361
00:17:21,942 --> 00:17:23,167
in more detail next time.

362
00:17:39,498 --> 00:17:41,287
For now, you don't have to

363
00:17:41,312 --> 00:17:43,334
describe the detailed curves of the body.

364
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:44,483
We're going to add them

365
00:17:44,508 --> 00:17:46,403
in the next stage.

366
00:17:46,428 --> 00:17:49,616
Now, you need to fix the proportions as you're looking at the reference.

367
00:17:49,726 --> 00:17:52,366
Remember we went over proportions in the last lecture?

368
00:17:52,391 --> 00:17:56,014
If you have your own version of human proportions,

369
00:17:56,178 --> 00:17:57,861
utilize it in your drawing.

370
00:17:58,045 --> 00:17:59,522
I'll use my version.

371
00:17:59,547 --> 00:18:02,616
The part where the ribs are split will be located

372
00:18:04,022 --> 00:18:05,250
at two-thirds of the head's height.

373
00:18:05,592 --> 00:18:09,061
The pelvis will stick out at a 1:1 proportion.

374
00:18:09,467 --> 00:18:13,155
Note that a female character's pelvis is wide, not tall.

375
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,564
So I'll set the height this much.

376
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:18,358
When you're drawing the legs

377
00:18:22,069 --> 00:18:23,184
and think how thick they are,

378
00:18:23,209 --> 00:18:26,858
keep in mind that they are thicker than the body.

379
00:18:26,883 --> 00:18:30,472
So, when you're drawing them,

380
00:18:30,497 --> 00:18:32,787
make them thick intentionally.

381
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:51,918
I'll draw the feet, too.

382
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,347
So, now I have a human body

383
00:19:03,512 --> 00:19:05,308
with the proportion I thought of.

384
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,099
Of course, the reference was the photo I had.

385
00:19:07,933 --> 00:19:10,676
At first, it's okay even if it takes some time.

386
00:19:10,701 --> 00:19:13,965
But, you should reduce the timeframe later on.

387
00:19:24,884 --> 00:19:27,181
Now that we're done with this stage,

388
00:19:27,206 --> 00:19:29,150
let's move on to the next stage.

389
00:19:29,175 --> 00:19:31,267
I'll make it slightly transparent.

390
00:19:32,277 --> 00:19:35,671
At this stage, it's okay to create a new layer.

391
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:53,752
I'll draw the eyes at where I marked.

392
00:20:09,984 --> 00:20:12,584
Let me draw a simplified hair.

393
00:21:08,906 --> 00:21:10,560
When you're drawing the detailed outlines,

394
00:21:10,585 --> 00:21:13,109
use your anatomical knowledge

395
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:16,898
to draw the chest,

396
00:21:16,923 --> 00:21:18,887
the physique and the muscles.

397
00:21:22,007 --> 00:21:25,210
At first, for this course, I wanted to

398
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,124
teach you more about anatomy

399
00:21:27,149 --> 00:21:28,593
or how you should draw outlines.

400
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:30,140
However, I omitted them

401
00:21:30,726 --> 00:21:33,601
because I am going to cover

402
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,437
practical knowledge in the latter part.

403
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:38,812
So, this course doesn't cover the basics much.

404
00:21:39,077 --> 00:21:42,273
But that doesn't mean they're unimportant.

405
00:21:42,298 --> 00:21:44,513
It just means other things are more important.

406
00:21:44,538 --> 00:21:48,960
I strongly recommend that you go over the basics

407
00:21:48,985 --> 00:21:50,679
as you study on your own.

408
00:21:51,171 --> 00:21:53,820
And you can draw a human body beautifully

409
00:21:55,218 --> 00:21:57,590
when you know the basics

410
00:21:57,591 --> 00:21:59,912
and when you can accurately describe the outlines.

411
00:22:02,991 --> 00:22:05,288
I'll go over how to draw a hand.

412
00:22:05,313 --> 00:22:08,706
A lot of people are afraid to draw it.

413
00:22:08,731 --> 00:22:11,505
I'll break it down into shapes.

414
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:12,880
If we look at the palm,

415
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:17,325
the wrist would come up to here.

416
00:22:18,533 --> 00:22:20,513
And, we would draw a cuboid

417
00:22:22,106 --> 00:22:23,927
with the same width as the wrist.

418
00:22:24,731 --> 00:22:29,841
If we divide this cuboid

419
00:22:30,036 --> 00:22:31,270
into three parts,

420
00:22:31,295 --> 00:22:34,739
they would be the index finger, the middle finger, and the ring finger.

421
00:22:34,911 --> 00:22:38,049
If we also look at the bone's length,

422
00:22:38,051 --> 00:22:40,114
the length of the middle finger

423
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:43,538
and the palm would be the same.

424
00:22:45,302 --> 00:22:47,380
You might ask why I only drew three fingers.

425
00:22:47,405 --> 00:22:50,440
I'm going to draw in the little finger and the thumb now.

426
00:22:50,989 --> 00:22:51,895
Like this.

427
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:58,856
If you draw in the thumb area like this,

428
00:22:58,881 --> 00:23:04,559
the little finger area would be located diagonally on the opposite side.

429
00:23:04,794 --> 00:23:06,223
Why would I draw them separately?

430
00:23:06,248 --> 00:23:08,652
Well, unlike the previous three fingers,

431
00:23:08,677 --> 00:23:12,005
you should identify the little finger and the thumb

432
00:23:12,192 --> 00:23:13,655
as separate areas.

433
00:23:13,657 --> 00:23:16,096
You should also keep in mind that

434
00:23:16,098 --> 00:23:18,809
the little finger is much smaller than the other fingers.

435
00:23:18,834 --> 00:23:20,247
The tip of the little finger barely reaches

436
00:23:20,272 --> 00:23:23,182
the second knuckle of the ring finger.

437
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:24,927
Also, the thumb is

438
00:23:24,952 --> 00:23:26,020
very small.

439
00:23:26,045 --> 00:23:29,044
So, there are a few common mistakes when drawing hands.

440
00:23:29,069 --> 00:23:31,794
First, a lot of people draw big index fingers.

441
00:23:31,926 --> 00:23:33,659
It becomes big because

442
00:23:33,684 --> 00:23:35,512
people usually draw things bigger

443
00:23:35,537 --> 00:23:38,153
when they drew them first.

444
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:40,089
People usually start with the index finger.

445
00:23:40,114 --> 00:23:41,723
So, as they continue drawing,

446
00:23:41,748 --> 00:23:43,769
the index finger becomes longer than the middle finger.

447
00:23:43,794 --> 00:23:45,762
This is a common mistake.

448
00:23:46,012 --> 00:23:48,614
Another common mistake is

449
00:23:48,639 --> 00:23:50,114
drawing the little finger

450
00:23:50,116 --> 00:23:52,567
just a bit shorter than the other fingers.

451
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:55,208
Even the reference you're looking at could look like this.

452
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:56,434
So, the final result could look awkward.

453
00:23:56,598 --> 00:23:58,609
When you open out your palm,

454
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:00,075
you'll get the feeling that

455
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,591
the little finger stretches out a bit more.

456
00:24:02,895 --> 00:24:04,817
This is why you should think of the little finger

457
00:24:04,842 --> 00:24:07,887
as a separate area from the rest of the fingers.

458
00:24:08,317 --> 00:24:10,688
So far, I've covered the hand structure.

459
00:24:11,895 --> 00:24:13,052
I'll go over the foot structure now.

460
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:17,122
With the foot, the tarsal bone becomes the standard.

461
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,481
When we look at it sideways,

462
00:24:19,942 --> 00:24:24,497
we would first draw a trapezoid.

463
00:24:25,169 --> 00:24:29,145
And, from the upper part of the trapezoid,

464
00:24:29,817 --> 00:24:31,462
I'll draw a diagonal line.

465
00:24:34,802 --> 00:24:35,864
This would be the toe.

466
00:24:36,403 --> 00:24:39,016
In fact, what I drew

467
00:24:39,018 --> 00:24:41,684
is a basic form that looks similar to the foot bone.

468
00:24:41,934 --> 00:24:44,044
There's the trapezoid, then there's the bone in front of it.

469
00:24:44,069 --> 00:24:45,997
And there's a blank space here.

470
00:24:46,098 --> 00:24:49,895
This blank space would be

471
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,817
the foot arch that we commonly draw.

472
00:24:52,302 --> 00:24:55,723
So, you should familiarize yourself with basic forms.

473
00:24:55,809 --> 00:24:58,591
Remember the forms for the hand and the foot.

474
00:25:06,114 --> 00:25:07,934
This curve along the thigh,

475
00:25:07,959 --> 00:25:11,573
in the front, the muscle goes above the knees.

476
00:25:11,598 --> 00:25:14,145
So, I'll draw the curve right up to here.

477
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:18,630
For this curve, I'll make it bulge just a bit and finish it off.

478
00:25:19,028 --> 00:25:22,247
When you look at the calves from the back,

479
00:25:24,192 --> 00:25:26,231
it sticks to the bone like this.

480
00:25:28,372 --> 00:25:29,932
It sticks right up to here.

481
00:25:29,934 --> 00:25:33,630
That means the thigh muscle is quite short.

482
00:25:33,655 --> 00:25:36,114
So, you should make it curved inwards, like this.

483
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,161
When you bend your knees,

484
00:25:42,186 --> 00:25:44,286
they tend to stick out forwards.

485
00:25:44,311 --> 00:25:46,591
I'll go over this.

486
00:25:51,403 --> 00:25:54,059
Remember when I taught you about kneecaps?

487
00:25:54,084 --> 00:25:56,270
A kneecap looks like this.

488
00:25:56,295 --> 00:25:58,218
And when it's bent, it becomes like this.

489
00:25:59,781 --> 00:26:01,497
See how it looks?

490
00:26:01,522 --> 00:26:03,880
So, when you look at it,

491
00:26:03,905 --> 00:26:05,059
it's slightly rectangular.

492
00:26:05,402 --> 00:26:06,489
Although it's slightly rectangular,

493
00:26:06,514 --> 00:26:08,223
it's not a perfect rectangle.

494
00:26:08,356 --> 00:26:10,255
It will stick out forwards

495
00:26:10,708 --> 00:26:12,505
and downwards

496
00:26:12,803 --> 00:26:14,372
like so.

497
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,677
That's all you need to know.

498
00:26:18,184 --> 00:26:19,716
When you bend your knees,

499
00:26:22,098 --> 00:26:23,794
because of how this bone looks,

500
00:26:25,348 --> 00:26:29,270
it looks as if the bone

501
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:31,128
is bulging out forwards.

502
00:26:34,544 --> 00:26:37,103
Here, we have the side joint that we covered last time.

503
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:40,216
This curve describes the side of a leg, and it is curved inwards a bit.

504
00:26:40,903 --> 00:26:42,822
Now, this will look like a curve.

505
00:26:42,823 --> 00:26:44,622
But, when you're drawing a bone,

506
00:26:46,005 --> 00:26:47,528
it will be vertical.

507
00:26:48,137 --> 00:26:51,208
Now, please remember this curve

508
00:26:51,233 --> 00:26:52,616
that is formed even when the leg is straight.

509
00:26:52,618 --> 00:26:53,799
A lot of people make mistakes here

510
00:26:53,801 --> 00:26:55,972
when they're drawing the leg.

511
00:26:55,997 --> 00:26:57,934
If you want to be a concept artist,

512
00:26:57,959 --> 00:27:00,075
you'll draw the legs a lot.

513
00:27:01,731 --> 00:27:03,552
We're now done with the third stage.

514
00:27:03,577 --> 00:27:06,270
In the third stage, we drew

515
00:27:06,295 --> 00:27:08,527
the specific curves

516
00:27:08,552 --> 00:27:10,011
of a character's body.

517
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:12,450
Actually, if you successfully finished this stage,

518
00:27:13,485 --> 00:27:16,351
you successfully went over most of the important stuff.

519
00:27:20,997 --> 00:27:25,567
So, that was how you apply simplification to a human body.

520
00:27:25,794 --> 00:27:29,014
Let's go over from the beginning.

521
00:27:29,255 --> 00:27:37,455
When you're doing the rough drafts, you should draw the general posing.

522
00:27:38,885 --> 00:27:41,163
And when you do so,

523
00:27:41,165 --> 00:27:43,580
simplify as much as you can.

524
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:50,669
If you simplify it too much,

525
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:52,566
it will be less accurate.

526
00:27:53,791 --> 00:27:55,438
But, you can draw much quickly.

527
00:27:56,049 --> 00:28:00,156
So, you should decide whether you prefer speed or accuracy

528
00:28:00,573 --> 00:28:03,174
and decide how much you simplify.

529
00:28:09,924 --> 00:28:13,495
You should keep practicing

530
00:28:13,496 --> 00:28:16,251
drawing a human body you want

531
00:28:16,354 --> 00:28:18,096
in 15 to 30 seconds.

532
00:28:19,346 --> 00:28:21,016
Like I mentioned before,

533
00:28:21,029 --> 00:28:24,709
this lecture will be about

534
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:28,851
acknowledging your weaknesses

535
00:28:28,853 --> 00:28:31,949
and finding the areas you need more practice

536
00:28:31,969 --> 00:28:34,002
instead of learning something new.

537
00:28:35,276 --> 00:28:37,698
Once you're done

538
00:28:38,487 --> 00:28:40,184
with the rough draft,

539
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:50,101
you would fix the proportions as you sketch the additional details.

540
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:53,945
Before you become familiar with the process,

541
00:28:53,947 --> 00:28:55,234
in this stage,

542
00:28:55,259 --> 00:28:58,500
your drawings could be a little stiff.

543
00:28:58,594 --> 00:28:59,548
So, when that happens,

544
00:28:59,573 --> 00:29:01,372
I always tell my students

545
00:29:01,374 --> 00:29:02,319
this.

546
00:29:02,344 --> 00:29:05,976
I tell them, the posture was a bit awkward

547
00:29:06,001 --> 00:29:08,000
when doing the rough draft.

548
00:29:08,617 --> 00:29:10,929
So, as they fix it,

549
00:29:10,954 --> 00:29:13,390
the proportions won't be correct.

550
00:29:13,558 --> 00:29:15,344
That is why

551
00:29:15,369 --> 00:29:16,445
the movement

552
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,484
becomes awkward.

553
00:29:17,509 --> 00:29:19,659
So, you might ask yourself

554
00:29:19,684 --> 00:29:21,891
whether you should put an emphasis on the proportions or the movements.

555
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:25,804
My advice is to

556
00:29:25,829 --> 00:29:27,226
put an emphasis on the movements.

557
00:29:28,898 --> 00:29:31,937
It's okay if the proportions are a bit wrong.

558
00:29:33,344 --> 00:29:36,344
Remember the last lecture when we learned about Deformers?

559
00:29:36,594 --> 00:29:38,413
As I mentioned

560
00:29:38,415 --> 00:29:39,773
when learning Deformers,

561
00:29:39,774 --> 00:29:42,240
the anatomy of our characters are already incorrect

562
00:29:42,265 --> 00:29:43,625
when we are drawing a casual style character.

563
00:29:44,711 --> 00:29:47,945
So, you don't have to focus too much on keeping it accurate.

564
00:29:48,476 --> 00:29:50,703
What's more important is the nuance.

565
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:54,289
The movement has the biggest impact on nuance.

566
00:29:54,586 --> 00:29:56,969
So, if you can find

567
00:29:56,994 --> 00:29:58,570
a more natural movement,

568
00:29:58,595 --> 00:30:00,328
it's okay even if you have

569
00:30:00,353 --> 00:30:02,235
incorrect proportions.

570
00:30:03,078 --> 00:30:05,304
That doesn't mean you can ignore them.

571
00:30:10,297 --> 00:30:12,484
If you have trouble describing the pose correctly,

572
00:30:12,509 --> 00:30:13,922
like I mentioned before,

573
00:30:14,883 --> 00:30:16,781
look at photo references.

574
00:30:16,953 --> 00:30:19,211
Keep training your muscle memory as you look at them.

575
00:30:19,236 --> 00:30:22,617
It's important to memorize them.

576
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:30,066
When you're sketching the additional details, you fix the proportions.

577
00:30:30,437 --> 00:30:32,234
For instance, whether the leg was a bit long,

578
00:30:34,219 --> 00:30:35,906
or whether the arm was a bit short.

579
00:30:35,931 --> 00:30:38,109
Keep fixing them at this stage.

580
00:30:38,945 --> 00:30:41,914
You don't have to put in the detailed curves of the body.

581
00:30:41,939 --> 00:30:44,695
I put some of them in because of my habit.

582
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:49,031
But, at this stage, you can draw the arms as a cylinder.

583
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,617
If a cylinder is too difficult,

584
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,054
this is fine too.

585
00:30:55,827 --> 00:30:56,906
It's okay even if

586
00:30:57,484 --> 00:30:58,695
you just draw a single line.

587
00:31:00,466 --> 00:31:01,375
Keep in mind that

588
00:31:01,377 --> 00:31:04,000
what you're doing now is drawing the human body easily.

589
00:31:04,025 --> 00:31:06,240
You're not drawing it accurately.

590
00:31:06,265 --> 00:31:07,920
So, if all this is too difficult,

591
00:31:07,945 --> 00:31:10,429
just draw in lumps like this.

592
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:14,344
But, of course,

593
00:31:14,369 --> 00:31:16,242
you should draw with lines later on.

594
00:31:22,476 --> 00:31:29,976
I'll just draw the location of the head

595
00:31:32,716 --> 00:31:34,140
in this stage.

596
00:31:44,212 --> 00:31:46,318
If some of the proportions are incorrect,

597
00:31:46,343 --> 00:31:47,613
you should correct them at this stage,

598
00:31:47,638 --> 00:31:50,998
and make it into the proportion you want.

599
00:31:58,946 --> 00:32:00,699
Now, let's move on to the next stage.

600
00:32:02,496 --> 00:32:05,410
Now, we're draw the outlines and the curves.

601
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:08,931
I'll teach you how to draw the head

602
00:32:08,933 --> 00:32:10,682
in the next lecture.

603
00:32:10,707 --> 00:32:12,489
So, once you learn that, draw the head at this stage.

604
00:33:00,715 --> 00:33:03,004
I'll just simplify it today.

605
00:33:04,709 --> 00:33:06,832
The next lecture goes thoroughly

606
00:33:07,837 --> 00:33:10,606
on how to draw the head.

607
00:33:21,113 --> 00:33:22,651
When you're drawing the curves,

608
00:33:22,676 --> 00:33:25,504
you'll notice your weaknesses quickly.

609
00:33:27,027 --> 00:33:29,277
If you want to draw them well,

610
00:33:29,302 --> 00:33:32,160
you need to understand how the muscles work.

611
00:33:32,162 --> 00:33:34,634
You also need to understand the physiques.

612
00:33:34,738 --> 00:33:37,723
So, the more you study,

613
00:33:38,605 --> 00:33:41,738
the more you will be able to depict various things.

614
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,504
So, I'd like to give

615
00:33:42,529 --> 00:33:45,124
some advice to those of you

616
00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:46,677
who just draw female characters.

617
00:33:49,254 --> 00:33:51,651
You should draw male characters

618
00:33:52,246 --> 00:33:53,285
sometime later on.

619
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:55,252
I'm suggesting this because there's a limit

620
00:33:55,277 --> 00:33:57,637
when you practice drawing muscles with female characters.

621
00:33:58,105 --> 00:33:59,428
When you're drawing a female character,

622
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:01,645
you usually won't depict six-pack abs in detail.

623
00:34:02,059 --> 00:34:04,324
So, when you're studying muscles,

624
00:34:04,349 --> 00:34:06,254
practicing with male characters

625
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:08,215
will help you much more.

626
00:34:08,465 --> 00:34:11,061
The point here is not drawing male characters itself.

627
00:34:11,063 --> 00:34:13,488
As you study male characters, you'll study muscles,

628
00:34:13,513 --> 00:34:16,004
and you'll later apply them to female characters.

629
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:19,526
So, instead of just drawing female characters,

630
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:23,449
if you can draw muscular male characters as well,

631
00:34:23,474 --> 00:34:25,733
it helps you a lot with female characters.

632
00:34:27,275 --> 00:34:28,918
It won't apply to all people, but usually

633
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:31,129
if you can draw both

634
00:34:31,154 --> 00:34:32,467
a muscular character

635
00:34:32,492 --> 00:34:34,215
and a female character well,

636
00:34:34,217 --> 00:34:36,535
that means your drawing skills are very settled.

637
00:34:42,012 --> 00:34:47,902
I've mentioned before that the upper part

638
00:34:47,927 --> 00:34:49,792
and the lower part of the leg are the same length.

639
00:34:50,512 --> 00:34:52,580
You can easily check this

640
00:34:54,493 --> 00:34:56,910
through the heel.

641
00:34:56,935 --> 00:34:58,816
When you're kneeling,

642
00:34:58,841 --> 00:35:02,248
the hips and the heel interlock perfectly.

643
00:35:02,887 --> 00:35:04,520
We sit down like this.

644
00:35:04,545 --> 00:35:05,465
When a character sits down,

645
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:09,715
and when its feet are located in the back,

646
00:35:10,613 --> 00:35:12,785
or when its feet are located forwards

647
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,739
so the hips are floating in the air,

648
00:35:14,764 --> 00:35:17,184
it will look a bit awkward.

649
00:35:24,066 --> 00:35:26,207
Drawing a grid

650
00:35:26,355 --> 00:35:28,525
helps a lot

651
00:35:28,527 --> 00:35:30,043
when you're studying anatomy.

652
00:35:35,244 --> 00:35:36,934
It helps with perspective.

653
00:35:38,527 --> 00:35:40,121
When you're drawing a grid,

654
00:35:40,146 --> 00:35:43,684
and when you've studied muscles,

655
00:35:43,709 --> 00:35:45,910
apply that knowledge as much as possible.

656
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,069
So, in other words,

657
00:35:47,071 --> 00:35:49,473
for example, the abs would go here.

658
00:35:50,012 --> 00:35:52,091
So, you would draw a curve like this.

659
00:35:53,105 --> 00:35:55,981
And you would add another curve where external oblique abdominal muscle is.

660
00:35:56,324 --> 00:35:59,051
You would divide it as much as you can.

661
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:03,551
If it is too difficult for you,

662
00:36:03,576 --> 00:36:04,613
and if you don't understand

663
00:36:04,638 --> 00:36:05,965
how muscles work,

664
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:07,164
you can just draw a cylinder.

665
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:08,458
Even this is difficult.

666
00:36:10,092 --> 00:36:12,316
So, you need to go over this a lot when practicing.

667
00:36:21,765 --> 00:36:24,096
That's how you'll study anatomy.

668
00:36:24,121 --> 00:36:27,710
If you become familiar, you should draw many different poses.

669
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:31,926
You should draw a male character as well.

670
00:36:41,419 --> 00:36:43,572
You will also set a specific angle for this character.

671
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,353
Now, a lot of students

672
00:36:47,915 --> 00:36:50,258
have difficulty

673
00:36:50,283 --> 00:36:52,415
understanding and applying perspective.

674
00:36:53,158 --> 00:36:55,220
It is really hard to understand.

675
00:36:55,478 --> 00:36:57,610
So, I'll go over this topic

676
00:36:58,244 --> 00:37:00,001
really quickly.

677
00:37:01,194 --> 00:37:03,158
You might wonder if perspective can be applied simply.

678
00:37:03,183 --> 00:37:04,884
It's actually a very important question.

679
00:37:05,376 --> 00:37:06,986
You might think

680
00:37:07,072 --> 00:37:08,621
you have to study as much as possible.

681
00:37:08,767 --> 00:37:09,669
Well, that is true.

682
00:37:09,671 --> 00:37:11,275
Of course, perspective is very important.

683
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,634
But if you study it in detail,

684
00:37:14,509 --> 00:37:16,447
you'll see terms like

685
00:37:16,472 --> 00:37:18,173
one-point, two-point, and three-point perspective

686
00:37:18,198 --> 00:37:19,072
which you might have seen in books.

687
00:37:19,415 --> 00:37:22,376
I'm sure most of you are familiar with this concept.

688
00:37:23,064 --> 00:37:25,525
They also teach you this in junior high.

689
00:37:26,126 --> 00:37:27,994
If you're unfamiliar with it,

690
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,218
go ahead and search the terms.

691
00:37:29,382 --> 00:37:32,515
Just Google up the word 'perspective'.

692
00:37:33,101 --> 00:37:34,426
In this class, I'll go over things

693
00:37:34,428 --> 00:37:36,216
that are more practical.

694
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:39,147
I'll stop drawing this male character for now,

695
00:37:41,888 --> 00:37:46,515
and teach you a bit about perspective.

696
00:37:48,124 --> 00:37:52,525
When you focus on what's important,

697
00:37:52,527 --> 00:37:53,960
you'll usually hear terms like

698
00:37:53,985 --> 00:37:56,812
one-point, two-point,

699
00:37:56,837 --> 00:37:58,662
and three-point perspective.

700
00:37:58,687 --> 00:38:02,183
But, it's hard to limit perspectives in to a few points.

701
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,976
Let me share an example.

702
00:38:04,363 --> 00:38:06,413
Let's say you're

703
00:38:09,421 --> 00:38:10,765
standing up Ike this.

704
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:12,007
You're here,

705
00:38:13,976 --> 00:38:14,944
and there are objects.

706
00:38:14,969 --> 00:38:16,083
I'll draw them in.

707
00:38:16,108 --> 00:38:18,702
There are long objects

708
00:38:20,937 --> 00:38:22,226
placed like this

709
00:38:24,741 --> 00:38:26,358
surrounding you.

710
00:38:30,874 --> 00:38:32,101
When they are placed like this,

711
00:38:32,126 --> 00:38:33,741
how will you see

712
00:38:35,163 --> 00:38:37,250
these objects?

713
00:38:41,993 --> 00:38:43,810
This panel shows

714
00:38:45,231 --> 00:38:46,897
how you will see them.

715
00:38:53,306 --> 00:38:56,468
Since four pillars are directed towards you, they will look like this.

716
00:38:56,749 --> 00:38:58,085
The point here is to

717
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:00,022
find the vanishing point of these pillars.

718
00:39:00,047 --> 00:39:01,062
What is a vanishing point?

719
00:39:01,087 --> 00:39:04,559
A vanishing point is when you can no longer see an object

720
00:39:04,584 --> 00:39:05,983
after it gets further away.

721
00:39:05,985 --> 00:39:07,116
So,

722
00:39:07,399 --> 00:39:09,247
if the pillar is stretched out like this,

723
00:39:09,272 --> 00:39:11,091
you won't be able to see it from here.

724
00:39:12,046 --> 00:39:13,537
You also won't see this pillar

725
00:39:13,538 --> 00:39:15,224
somewhere starting from here.

726
00:39:15,249 --> 00:39:16,358
That goes the same

727
00:39:16,608 --> 00:39:17,765
for these two pillars as well.

728
00:39:18,414 --> 00:39:20,707
So, we already have four vanishing points.

729
00:39:22,241 --> 00:39:25,093
So, although we commonly mention

730
00:39:25,118 --> 00:39:27,198
one-point, two-point, and three-point perspectives,

731
00:39:27,223 --> 00:39:29,350
the number of vanishing points can be infinite

732
00:39:29,375 --> 00:39:31,904
depending on the shape of an object

733
00:39:31,906 --> 00:39:33,510
and it's hard to identify all of them.

734
00:39:33,512 --> 00:39:35,635
But that doesn't mean we don't have to study it.

735
00:39:35,637 --> 00:39:39,140
Here, I'll just go over perspectives for character drawing.

736
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:48,827
I'll just emphasize what's important.

737
00:39:49,623 --> 00:39:51,421
First of all,

738
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:55,319
even a single object has perspective,

739
00:39:55,741 --> 00:39:57,718
though it could vary according to distance.

740
00:39:57,897 --> 00:39:59,108
For example,

741
00:39:59,288 --> 00:40:03,163
when you see a giant in comics,

742
00:40:04,022 --> 00:40:06,727
you might have seen it being presented like this.

743
00:40:08,194 --> 00:40:10,428
It will have a fist like this,

744
00:40:13,194 --> 00:40:16,054
and will often have glaring eyes.

745
00:40:17,476 --> 00:40:19,515
If you analyze it,

746
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:26,304
you'll see that perspective is already applied to this giant.

747
00:40:28,155 --> 00:40:29,380
Let me paraphrase it.

748
00:40:29,382 --> 00:40:31,062
When you're applying perspective,

749
00:40:31,087 --> 00:40:33,193
some of you may apply it

750
00:40:33,218 --> 00:40:34,907
like this.

751
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,077
And you may argue that it's a low-angle shot,

752
00:40:42,475 --> 00:40:45,374
and start to work on it.

753
00:40:45,491 --> 00:40:46,890
But, if you do this,

754
00:40:46,915 --> 00:40:49,060
the character would look stiff

755
00:40:49,085 --> 00:40:50,718
and it will look a bit awkward.

756
00:40:50,743 --> 00:40:51,772
Why does that happen?

757
00:40:51,797 --> 00:40:55,109
As you approach this giant,

758
00:40:55,476 --> 00:40:57,570
these perspective lines will go further away from each other.

759
00:40:57,572 --> 00:40:59,704
When we have a can,

760
00:40:59,706 --> 00:41:01,790
and if it is far away,

761
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,015
it would look like this.

762
00:41:04,046 --> 00:41:06,155
Under the premise that it is on the same eye-level as ours,

763
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,476
it will look like this if it's far from us.

764
00:41:09,046 --> 00:41:11,140
But, what if it is up close?

765
00:41:11,413 --> 00:41:15,757
It will look like this.

766
00:41:16,702 --> 00:41:18,476
If it's right in front of our eyes,

767
00:41:18,501 --> 00:41:22,101
the label would be written like this.

768
00:41:23,999 --> 00:41:27,274
As an object comes closer,

769
00:41:27,299 --> 00:41:29,374
the perspective widens.

770
00:41:30,765 --> 00:41:32,476
Keep that in mind.

771
00:41:32,501 --> 00:41:34,069
So, when you're drawing a character,

772
00:41:34,094 --> 00:41:36,429
you should be aware of

773
00:41:36,454 --> 00:41:37,960
the perspective widening.

774
00:41:39,269 --> 00:41:40,836
Even if it is a high-angle shot,

775
00:41:40,837 --> 00:41:45,772
The upper side will look like this

776
00:41:46,233 --> 00:41:49,288
and the underside will look like this.

777
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:53,272
The perspective will be applied like that.

778
00:41:53,843 --> 00:41:56,241
So, with this cuboid,

779
00:41:56,351 --> 00:41:58,413
the upper and the underside

780
00:41:58,438 --> 00:42:00,772
won't look exactly the same.

781
00:42:02,015 --> 00:42:05,780
Different perspectives would be applied to them.

782
00:42:07,063 --> 00:42:09,843
We would have a vanishing point like this.

783
00:42:13,937 --> 00:42:18,647
I've labeled them A and B, and I'll apply it to A.

784
00:42:19,108 --> 00:42:21,226
That was the most important thing.

785
00:42:21,944 --> 00:42:23,295
Ironically, the second most important thing

786
00:42:24,171 --> 00:42:27,044
could go against what I said so far.

787
00:42:27,647 --> 00:42:30,851
Don't focus on this cuboid so much.

788
00:42:31,538 --> 00:42:33,622
What am I talking about?

789
00:42:34,452 --> 00:42:36,912
I'll put in a character in here.

790
00:42:37,093 --> 00:42:38,687
Think of it similarly to

791
00:42:38,712 --> 00:42:40,921
sculpting something.

792
00:42:40,946 --> 00:42:42,349
What would a sculptor do?

793
00:42:42,374 --> 00:42:43,718
There would be a chunk of marble,

794
00:42:43,743 --> 00:42:46,437
and they would sculpt a human as they chisel it down.

795
00:42:46,491 --> 00:42:48,138
But, us humans,

796
00:42:48,757 --> 00:42:49,968
we're not like robots.

797
00:42:50,444 --> 00:42:52,960
No one stands up perfectly vertically.

798
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:55,302
It will be easy for us to draw

799
00:42:55,304 --> 00:42:56,608
if a character stands vertically

800
00:42:57,866 --> 00:43:00,468
and holds out its arm like this.

801
00:43:01,108 --> 00:43:02,522
Drawing it would be easy

802
00:43:02,547 --> 00:43:04,252
and it would be easy to apply perspective as well.

803
00:43:04,277 --> 00:43:06,046
But, in reality, no one stands up like this.

804
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,647
Our waists could be bent

805
00:43:10,726 --> 00:43:12,022
and also

806
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:14,226
our legs could be limping sideways.

807
00:43:14,983 --> 00:43:15,890
We can cross them as well.

808
00:43:15,983 --> 00:43:17,905
Humans have many different poses.

809
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:20,787
So, it's never easy to

810
00:43:21,046 --> 00:43:23,210
utilize these lines within the cuboid

811
00:43:23,235 --> 00:43:24,046
and calculate how a human body would look.

812
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:26,210
But, there is still a way to calculate it.

813
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:30,525
Let's say this cuboid contains a character's upper body.

814
00:43:42,189 --> 00:43:45,971
A male character's upper body is located here, for example.

815
00:43:47,439 --> 00:43:49,087
Here, you would calculate like this.

816
00:43:49,112 --> 00:43:51,783
You need to make sure

817
00:43:51,994 --> 00:43:52,986
that these two lines are parallel,

818
00:43:54,877 --> 00:43:59,218
and that these two lines are parallel.

819
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,689
Like this.

820
00:44:03,635 --> 00:44:05,307
That's all I'll tell you.

821
00:44:05,332 --> 00:44:06,635
But, even if the waist is just a bit tilted,

822
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,846
this can't be applied.

823
00:44:09,018 --> 00:44:14,096
So, don't be too stressed that this is a cuboid.

824
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:16,205
With perspectives, it is better that it looks correct

825
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:17,932
than it is actually correct.

826
00:44:20,036 --> 00:44:22,283
Let's say there is a background with a perspective like this

827
00:44:26,057 --> 00:44:28,494
when we're looking at an object.

828
00:44:30,213 --> 00:44:31,523
The desk is here,

829
00:44:35,207 --> 00:44:36,939
and the chair is there.

830
00:44:44,984 --> 00:44:47,807
We have a background like this.

831
00:44:50,266 --> 00:44:53,010
You could say it's a standard background.

832
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:01,674
But if this background has this kind of perspective,

833
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:11,908
and if the floor tile looks like this,

834
00:45:16,425 --> 00:45:18,533
it will look awkward.

835
00:45:22,611 --> 00:45:27,096
We had a certain way of perceiving this background's perspective.

836
00:45:29,205 --> 00:45:31,338
But, now we have lines that go diagonally against it.

837
00:45:31,363 --> 00:45:33,229
So it looks awkward now.

838
00:45:33,254 --> 00:45:36,135
But, you might disagree and say that

839
00:45:36,338 --> 00:45:38,525
a tile like that exists in real life.

840
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:41,567
However, because it looks awkward,

841
00:45:41,569 --> 00:45:43,804
we won't apply that to our drawing.

842
00:45:44,447 --> 00:45:45,882
So, in this case,

843
00:45:45,884 --> 00:45:48,471
we would try to draw the tiles

844
00:45:48,689 --> 00:45:51,314
along this line, like this.

845
00:45:55,971 --> 00:45:58,369
Then it will look much less awkward.

846
00:45:58,394 --> 00:46:01,541
Thus, it's not as important that it is correct.

847
00:46:01,566 --> 00:46:03,081
It's more important

848
00:46:03,106 --> 00:46:04,791
that it doesn't look awkward.

849
00:46:04,816 --> 00:46:05,494
So, when you're drawing

850
00:46:06,057 --> 00:46:09,122
and applying perspective to a character,

851
00:46:09,147 --> 00:46:13,985
it is really important to

852
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:16,275
just make look fine

853
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:19,090
while you have an overall grasp of perspective

854
00:46:19,115 --> 00:46:22,377
and know that you should apply perspective

855
00:46:22,402 --> 00:46:24,854
instead of drawing it 100% accurately.

856
00:46:28,518 --> 00:46:29,539
So, now I've covered all of

857
00:46:29,564 --> 00:46:32,260
what I wanted to say about perspective.

858
00:46:32,604 --> 00:46:34,072
A lot of you find it difficult

859
00:46:34,097 --> 00:46:36,010
when applying perspective to a character.

860
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,564
But, before you consider that,

861
00:46:38,589 --> 00:46:42,059
you should know

862
00:46:42,084 --> 00:46:42,955
whether what you want to do is

863
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:44,047
to draw very accurately

864
00:46:44,072 --> 00:46:45,964
or to draw a good looking character

865
00:46:45,989 --> 00:46:47,881
with some perspective applied.

866
00:46:49,116 --> 00:46:51,064
Let me draw a low-angle shot character.

867
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:54,209
Basically, this character

868
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:58,299
would look bigger if it's closer to us.

869
00:47:00,338 --> 00:47:02,102
I've mentioned before that with male characters,

870
00:47:02,104 --> 00:47:04,525
they have broad shoulders and narrow hips.

871
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:06,900
Well, in this case, it becomes the opposite.

872
00:47:08,002 --> 00:47:09,463
He would have narrow shoulders

873
00:47:09,488 --> 00:47:11,096
and broad hips.

874
00:47:17,947 --> 00:47:21,314
I'll also apply the basics I've mentioned before.

875
00:47:25,744 --> 00:47:27,268
Draw the legs

876
00:47:28,129 --> 00:47:30,182
so that it gets thicker

877
00:47:33,644 --> 00:47:35,155
at the bottom.

878
00:47:38,812 --> 00:47:40,457
If he's bending his arms,

879
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:41,658
this part would look like this.

880
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:45,213
And if we apply a low-angle shot here,

881
00:47:46,212 --> 00:47:49,104
it would look as if he's stretching his arms.

882
00:48:15,788 --> 00:48:17,451
Now that I'm done with the rough draft,

883
00:48:17,453 --> 00:48:19,116
I'll move on to the next stage.

884
00:48:28,881 --> 00:48:30,967
Like I mentioned before, in this stage,

885
00:48:31,569 --> 00:48:33,811
we have to fix the proportions.

886
00:48:37,546 --> 00:48:39,803
I'll just draw a few outlines.

887
00:48:40,211 --> 00:48:42,436
This would be where the upper body will be split.

888
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:45,632
And that would be the belly button.

889
00:48:46,889 --> 00:48:48,600
Let's check

890
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:49,700
if I have the 1:1 ratio.

891
00:48:49,725 --> 00:48:51,272
I'll describe the pelvis.

892
00:48:52,366 --> 00:48:54,218
Sketch in the additional details

893
00:48:59,833 --> 00:49:02,507
while making sure that this information are applied.

894
00:49:14,608 --> 00:49:17,053
I'll also draw the basic form of the hand.

895
00:49:18,202 --> 00:49:19,507
I'll draw three fingers

896
00:49:22,569 --> 00:49:25,537
and a separate little finger area

897
00:49:25,538 --> 00:49:26,928
like I taught you.

898
00:49:28,136 --> 00:49:29,544
I'll also add in

899
00:49:29,569 --> 00:49:30,952
a separate thumb area.

900
00:49:47,296 --> 00:49:49,269
Now that I'm done with stage,

901
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:50,890
I'll move on to the third stage.

902
00:49:51,083 --> 00:49:54,153
Now, I'm going to draw more detailed outlines

903
00:49:54,265 --> 00:49:56,153
and show the character's muscles.

904
00:49:56,154 --> 00:49:57,843
There's the sternocleidomastoid muscle

905
00:49:59,046 --> 00:50:00,109
and the trapezius muscle.

906
00:50:00,134 --> 00:50:02,319
Remember I said the trapezius muscle is part of the shoulder?

907
00:50:05,162 --> 00:50:05,991
Along with the collarbone

908
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:09,273
and the deltoid muscle,

909
00:50:09,298 --> 00:50:11,077
they are all part of the shoulders.

910
00:50:11,102 --> 00:50:13,702
This would be the part we massage.

911
00:50:13,727 --> 00:50:14,796
The actual shoulder area is here.

912
00:50:14,821 --> 00:50:16,679
To be precise, the trapezius muscle

913
00:50:16,704 --> 00:50:17,726
is the back, not the shoulder.

914
00:50:18,148 --> 00:50:21,280
So, when we're massaging our 'shoulders',

915
00:50:21,305 --> 00:50:23,562
we're massaging our back.

916
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,155
But I'll just call them shoulders so that you'll understand.

917
00:50:29,295 --> 00:50:30,819
These would be the chest muscles.

918
00:50:33,437 --> 00:50:35,569
I'll add in the ribs.

919
00:50:36,327 --> 00:50:38,835
Remember I said

920
00:50:38,944 --> 00:50:40,218
there's the belly button

921
00:50:40,243 --> 00:50:41,754
on the third rectangle of the abs?

922
00:50:41,779 --> 00:50:43,537
This second rectangle

923
00:50:43,562 --> 00:50:46,515
will stick with the ribs.

924
00:50:50,413 --> 00:50:52,632
Like I mentioned, with the shoulders,

925
00:50:52,657 --> 00:50:55,085
there's also the latissimus dorsi muscle and the scapula.

926
00:50:57,206 --> 00:50:58,171
So I'll add them in.

927
00:51:01,299 --> 00:51:04,859
We refer to this as the external oblique muscle.

928
00:51:08,125 --> 00:51:09,325
I'll add in the abs.

929
00:51:11,653 --> 00:51:14,683
Now, it's good to

930
00:51:14,708 --> 00:51:16,145
give some space between the muscles.

931
00:51:16,833 --> 00:51:19,854
Basically, muscles stick to the bones.

932
00:51:19,879 --> 00:51:22,614
So, instead of understanding as muscles sticking to each other,

933
00:51:22,639 --> 00:51:25,637
understand it as muscles sticking to the bones.

934
00:51:25,731 --> 00:51:29,520
When you're moving your joints,

935
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:30,856
these would be the bones

936
00:51:30,881 --> 00:51:32,229
and the muscle would stick between them.

937
00:51:32,254 --> 00:51:35,879
As it contracts, this bone would go upwards.

938
00:51:36,512 --> 00:51:39,340
And as it expands, this bone would go downwards.

939
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:45,325
Just remember that it sticks to the bones.

940
00:51:48,926 --> 00:51:50,583
Remember when we learned arm muscles?

941
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:52,925
This line bulges out slightly.

942
00:51:52,950 --> 00:51:54,833
And that line bulges out a lot and goes back in.

943
00:51:54,919 --> 00:51:57,737
This one bulges out a lot,

944
00:51:57,762 --> 00:52:00,356
and that one is just slightly curved.

945
00:52:01,114 --> 00:52:02,833
I'll draw the hands simply

946
00:52:04,794 --> 00:52:06,661
while applying what we've learned.

947
00:52:07,801 --> 00:52:09,692
When we're learning how to draw faces,

948
00:52:10,044 --> 00:52:11,379
and if we have time,

949
00:52:11,489 --> 00:52:12,864
let's draw the hand too.

950
00:52:15,087 --> 00:52:16,356
There's nothing too much to do.

951
00:52:16,381 --> 00:52:19,455
Like other body areas, the details of the hands

952
00:52:20,915 --> 00:52:23,176
become different depending on

953
00:52:23,201 --> 00:52:24,856
how much you describe the muscles or the physique.

954
00:52:26,575 --> 00:52:27,862
So, now we have

955
00:52:27,887 --> 00:52:30,675
a human body with a slight low-angle shot.

956
00:52:33,309 --> 00:52:36,401
Don't baffle yourself too much with perspectives.

957
00:52:36,426 --> 00:52:38,786
You can see it everywhere.

958
00:52:38,811 --> 00:52:40,129
It is always applied in real life.

959
00:52:40,154 --> 00:52:41,879
Even when we're looking at a still object,

960
00:52:41,904 --> 00:52:43,812
there's some perspective applied.

961
00:52:43,837 --> 00:52:46,739
Take this photo reference, for example.

962
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,965
We can't properly see her feet.

963
00:52:49,582 --> 00:52:52,704
The photo is already set in a high-angle shot.

964
00:52:54,387 --> 00:52:56,911
You might not think so

965
00:52:56,936 --> 00:52:58,325
and think that we're looking at her

966
00:52:58,350 --> 00:52:59,903
from our eye-level.

967
00:53:00,286 --> 00:53:01,939
But, even if we were looking at her from eye-level,

968
00:53:01,941 --> 00:53:05,033
if you look closely, you'll notice that as we look down,

969
00:53:05,035 --> 00:53:06,239
there's a high-angle shot applied.

970
00:53:07,536 --> 00:53:10,856
So, in our daily lives, we always see perspective.

971
00:53:10,997 --> 00:53:13,053
It always exists.

972
00:53:13,055 --> 00:53:15,403
So don't stress yourselves too much with it.

973
00:53:15,822 --> 00:53:18,731
Just focus on creating the illusion of

974
00:53:18,756 --> 00:53:20,122
making it look natural.

975
00:53:22,723 --> 00:53:26,051
Today, I've covered capturing the movement

976
00:53:26,076 --> 00:53:28,392
and how to approach perspective.

977
00:53:28,417 --> 00:53:30,348
We should summarize it.

978
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:36,403
But first, let's go over

979
00:53:37,828 --> 00:53:38,669
what we learned in the last lecture.

980
00:53:40,669 --> 00:53:43,044
In the previous lecture,

981
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:47,059
we learned how to draw a simple mannequin.

982
00:53:47,333 --> 00:53:48,840
If you didn't understand just yet,

983
00:53:48,865 --> 00:53:50,840
give it some time.

984
00:53:51,075 --> 00:53:53,965
Today's exercise was based on the premise that

985
00:53:54,379 --> 00:53:57,270
we made a simple mannequin

986
00:53:57,295 --> 00:54:00,073
with your own proportions.

987
00:54:00,098 --> 00:54:01,938
The first step of today's exercise was

988
00:54:02,114 --> 00:54:04,876
to simplify this mannequin even more.

989
00:54:07,028 --> 00:54:08,450
The reason behind this is to

990
00:54:08,475 --> 00:54:09,887
work more quickly

991
00:54:11,309 --> 00:54:14,408
while being as accurate as possible

992
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:18,348
and describe what you're thinking as accurately as possible.

993
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,669
That was the key point

994
00:54:20,872 --> 00:54:21,981
of simplification.

995
00:54:22,689 --> 00:54:25,708
So, practicing with what you've simplified

996
00:54:27,093 --> 00:54:28,684
is a very important process.

997
00:54:31,161 --> 00:54:33,986
I advise you to use photo references.

998
00:54:35,072 --> 00:54:38,275
Of course, illustration references and figure references are okay too.

999
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:39,767
They should work fine.

1000
00:54:39,792 --> 00:54:42,172
But, I still think photo references are the best.

1001
00:54:42,197 --> 00:54:46,150
Because, when a character is illustrated based on a photo,

1002
00:54:46,175 --> 00:54:47,850
a lot of information is omitted.

1003
00:54:47,875 --> 00:54:49,860
For example, we might not be able to see

1004
00:54:49,885 --> 00:54:51,392
the muscles and bones, unlike a photo reference.

1005
00:54:51,417 --> 00:54:53,213
Or, you might not be able to see the perspective well.

1006
00:54:53,238 --> 00:54:55,033
The illustrator could have distorted

1007
00:54:55,189 --> 00:54:57,924
something on purpose, too.

1008
00:54:57,949 --> 00:54:59,814
After all, it's done by a human.

1009
00:55:00,127 --> 00:55:01,806
Because of this,

1010
00:55:01,808 --> 00:55:05,596
I think photo references are the best.

1011
00:55:05,705 --> 00:55:09,580
But, if you're still unfamiliar with proportions,

1012
00:55:09,605 --> 00:55:12,141
I'll go over this quickly

1013
00:55:12,166 --> 00:55:13,611
in addition to what we've done last time.

1014
00:55:14,135 --> 00:55:15,906
But, I'll divide it into a few steps.

1015
00:55:17,986 --> 00:55:19,939
In the last lecture, we practiced how to apply

1016
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:23,939
proportions and outlines.

1017
00:55:27,221 --> 00:55:30,063
To practice proportions,

1018
00:55:30,088 --> 00:55:32,721
it is best to do it with figures.

1019
00:55:34,267 --> 00:55:36,425
This is because they're already 'complete'.

1020
00:55:36,427 --> 00:55:38,852
Because they are already deformed,

1021
00:55:38,854 --> 00:55:41,148
we can apply that to our drawings.

1022
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:42,775
With just a small personal touch,

1023
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:45,666
you'll find the right answer for your drawing style.

1024
00:55:45,799 --> 00:55:47,486
So, when you're practicing proportions,

1025
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:49,994
it is the best

1026
00:55:50,019 --> 00:55:51,931
to imitate figures.

1027
00:55:52,127 --> 00:55:55,025
When you're practicing outlines,

1028
00:55:55,533 --> 00:55:57,369
look at photos and illustrations together.

1029
00:55:57,752 --> 00:56:00,096
I'll repeat,

1030
00:56:01,783 --> 00:56:03,324
you should study outlines

1031
00:56:03,326 --> 00:56:05,150
with photos and illustrations.

1032
00:56:07,635 --> 00:56:08,455
But why so?

1033
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:09,780
As I mentioned before,

1034
00:56:09,782 --> 00:56:12,721
photographs describe details that illustrations don't.

1035
00:56:12,893 --> 00:56:15,492
The same is true

1036
00:56:15,517 --> 00:56:17,775
vice versa.

1037
00:56:17,885 --> 00:56:20,446
So, it is the best to

1038
00:56:20,471 --> 00:56:22,791
practice as you compare them.

1039
00:56:22,816 --> 00:56:24,696
I won't recommend looking at figures for this.

1040
00:56:24,721 --> 00:56:27,072
Because the outlines of figures

1041
00:56:27,074 --> 00:56:29,175
are always much simplified

1042
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:31,391
compared to those of illustrations.

1043
00:56:31,416 --> 00:56:33,299
It's hard to distinguish them well, too.

1044
00:56:33,324 --> 00:56:35,045
So, instead of using them,

1045
00:56:35,213 --> 00:56:36,921
use photos and illustrations

1046
00:56:36,923 --> 00:56:38,752
to practice drawing outlines.

1047
00:56:39,017 --> 00:56:40,799
But the most important thing is

1048
00:56:41,963 --> 00:56:43,549
to set the correct proportions

1049
00:56:43,574 --> 00:56:45,900
to acquire proper knowledge.

1050
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:48,611
And now, with movements, as I mentioned before,

1051
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:52,932
I recommend looking at photos.

1052
00:56:53,807 --> 00:56:56,088
Of course, you can also

1053
00:56:56,113 --> 00:56:57,462
look at figures.

1054
00:56:57,487 --> 00:57:00,174
But, if your goal is to capture the pose,

1055
00:57:00,199 --> 00:57:01,486
I strongly recommend photo materials.

1056
00:57:01,577 --> 00:57:04,937
So, you would use this photo reference to make a character

1057
00:57:05,351 --> 00:57:06,624
with the proportions you thought of.

1058
00:57:08,953 --> 00:57:10,579
That would be the rough draft stage.

1059
00:57:10,581 --> 00:57:12,632
You should practice

1060
00:57:12,657 --> 00:57:14,402
utilizing a certain pose to apply

1061
00:57:14,427 --> 00:57:15,918
your own proportions to your character.

1062
00:57:16,179 --> 00:57:17,427
Once that's done,

1063
00:57:20,502 --> 00:57:21,492
first of all,

1064
00:57:21,827 --> 00:57:24,796
you should just focus on the movements.

1065
00:57:27,195 --> 00:57:31,703
Then you would fix the proportions

1066
00:57:32,023 --> 00:57:35,999
and then you would draw detailed outlines.

1067
00:57:39,124 --> 00:57:40,835
Outlines and curves.

1068
00:57:42,179 --> 00:57:44,718
And if you actually want to finalize it,

1069
00:57:44,743 --> 00:57:46,174
draw the lines as well.

1070
00:57:46,219 --> 00:57:47,788
I highly recommend you to

1071
00:57:48,499 --> 00:57:51,695
practice with this method.

1072
00:57:52,749 --> 00:57:55,968
If you practice while looking at photos,

1073
00:57:55,993 --> 00:57:58,279
you can also practice

1074
00:57:58,304 --> 00:57:59,787
how to analyze perspectives.

1075
00:57:59,812 --> 00:58:01,968
So, I'll emphasize once more

1076
00:58:05,723 --> 00:58:08,861
that today's lecture focused on

1077
00:58:08,886 --> 00:58:11,018
drawing a lot so that

1078
00:58:13,502 --> 00:58:18,454
you would be able to

1079
00:58:18,479 --> 00:58:19,575
look at different angles and poses

1080
00:58:19,577 --> 00:58:23,091
and draw the same pose from different angles

1081
00:58:23,093 --> 00:58:26,018
and imagine a human body

1082
00:58:26,043 --> 00:58:27,846
from different angles and poses.

1083
00:58:31,252 --> 00:58:33,891
Today, we studied a bit on anatomy.

1084
00:58:33,916 --> 00:58:36,297
Next time, we'll study faces.

1085
00:58:36,299 --> 00:58:38,766
We drew a mannequin today

1086
00:58:38,791 --> 00:58:42,354
and learned how to move it.

1087
00:58:45,807 --> 00:58:48,915
We move it after simplifying it.

1088
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,619
Now that we've learned how to do it,

1089
00:58:50,644 --> 00:58:52,565
we are going to draw in the face.

1090
00:58:52,986 --> 00:58:54,596
Just simply think of it as

1091
00:58:54,621 --> 00:58:55,716
a character with a face

1092
00:58:55,741 --> 00:58:59,041
is moving around.

1093
00:58:59,066 --> 00:59:01,577
When you finish the next lecture,

1094
00:59:01,602 --> 00:59:03,408
you'd be able to draw a character.

1095
00:59:03,799 --> 00:59:05,861
So, that would be it for today.

1096
00:59:05,886 --> 00:59:08,023
I'll see you in the next lecture.

1097
00:59:08,906 --> 00:59:10,193
Keep up the good work,

1098
00:59:10,195 --> 00:59:13,328
and that would be the end for today's class.
