00:00:06,086 --> 00:00:07,132
Hello.

3
00:00:07,484 --> 00:00:10,336
Today, I'm going to draw a full illustration.

4
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:13,320
Out of the 8 types of illustrations we did,

5
00:00:13,609 --> 00:00:15,906
there was an illustration that was set in the evening.

6
00:00:16,047 --> 00:00:19,047
I'm going to use this to do a full illustration.

7
00:00:19,271 --> 00:00:21,867
Why did I choose this among all the illustrations?

8
00:00:21,891 --> 00:00:24,055
There are many reasons.

9
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:25,836
Later, for the Portrait Illustration,

10
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,320
I originally thought of choosing between #3 and #4.

11
00:00:28,484 --> 00:00:30,984
But the working process for portrait illustration

12
00:00:31,008 --> 00:00:33,008
will overlap with the 3rd and 4th images.

13
00:00:33,032 --> 00:00:34,297
So, with full illustration,

14
00:00:34,321 --> 00:00:37,695
I'm going to show you this evening background

15
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:39,906
because it contains the most information in lighting.

16
00:00:40,203 --> 00:00:42,586
We will describe it according to the background

17
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,039
and I'll tell you what you should pay attention to when you're doing description.

18
00:00:46,122 --> 00:00:48,654
I'll also tell you what I think is important.

19
00:00:48,665 --> 00:00:50,945
So, let's move on.

20
00:00:51,319 --> 00:00:53,389
First, we have to talk about

21
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,117
the lighting of an illustration.

22
00:00:55,141 --> 00:00:57,227
This illustration's lighting is set in the evening.

23
00:00:57,251 --> 00:00:59,403
I used light to describe this.

24
00:00:59,427 --> 00:01:03,011
The character in an orange and dark background

25
00:01:03,035 --> 00:01:05,128
receives a strong orange light

26
00:01:05,152 --> 00:01:08,423
from the top left.

27
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,564
The area where the light comes in isn't that wide.

28
00:01:13,124 --> 00:01:14,423
Where there's no light,

29
00:01:14,434 --> 00:01:16,902
most of the background is contained.

30
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:22,273
The character has a lot of subtle vibes.

31
00:01:22,297 --> 00:01:24,830
So, to make the overall mood look more subtle,

32
00:01:24,854 --> 00:01:27,315
the description process will be important.

33
00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:29,858
When you give this kind of lighting,

34
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:32,500
you're going to use this quite often.

35
00:01:32,524 --> 00:01:34,205
The illustration could be set in the evening,

36
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:35,604
or it could be set at night.

37
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:38,388
What's important when you put a lot of darkness in the lighting is

38
00:01:38,412 --> 00:01:41,278
to make sure it doesn't get too bright.

39
00:01:41,302 --> 00:01:42,296
That's the basic thing.

40
00:01:42,306 --> 00:01:46,282
I'm drawing an illustration with a dark background,

41
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:48,027
so it's important to be careful not to make the whole thing bright.

42
00:01:48,037 --> 00:01:49,138
In a way, it could be obvious.

43
00:01:49,162 --> 00:01:50,686
What's important is,

44
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,810
that you should separate

45
00:01:53,835 --> 00:01:55,189
the frontal light and the light coming from the top left.

46
00:01:56,957 --> 00:01:58,143
This area is not currently affected by

47
00:01:58,167 --> 00:02:01,716
the light coming from the top left.

48
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,479
That means, this area is a shadow.

49
00:02:05,018 --> 00:02:08,648
So you can say that this area is not affected

50
00:02:08,673 --> 00:02:10,399
by the light from the top left.

51
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,250
Then, let's see what kind of light this character is affected by.

52
00:02:14,527 --> 00:02:15,540
Background color.

53
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:18,574
It's a light coming from various angles.

54
00:02:18,909 --> 00:02:21,925
Among them, the one that looks the brightest to our eyes is

55
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:24,099
the one that sticks out the most.

56
00:02:24,124 --> 00:02:25,192
From our point of view,

57
00:02:25,241 --> 00:02:28,935
it's okay to understand it as

58
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,781
the light spreading in the front and center.

59
00:02:30,873 --> 00:02:33,835
So, if there's a highlight here,

60
00:02:33,859 --> 00:02:35,874
the left won't be highlighted that much.

61
00:02:35,898 --> 00:02:37,678
Instead, the middle area will be highlighted.

62
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:40,916
Of course, even if the highlight goes in,

63
00:02:41,037 --> 00:02:44,352
the frontal light itself is weak,

64
00:02:44,537 --> 00:02:47,785
so it needs to be softer

65
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,085
than the light coming from the top left.

66
00:02:54,156 --> 00:02:55,632
I might have mentioned this earlier.

67
00:02:55,663 --> 00:02:58,324
The description is not the key point with illustrations.

68
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,978
It's only an additional factor.

69
00:03:00,571 --> 00:03:02,626
Yes, I still tell that

70
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:04,722
to my students,

71
00:03:04,747 --> 00:03:06,210
and I still think so, too.

72
00:03:06,295 --> 00:03:09,271
In fact, description skills shows the artist's

73
00:03:09,296 --> 00:03:11,238
unique abilities.

74
00:03:11,249 --> 00:03:12,313
We could say it's important.

75
00:03:12,964 --> 00:03:16,731
But when it comes to coloring,

76
00:03:16,756 --> 00:03:18,369
it's an additional element.

77
00:03:18,901 --> 00:03:21,792
At the lighting stage, the theoretical contents of the illustration

78
00:03:21,817 --> 00:03:23,134
are almost done with.

79
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,584
And adding descriptions from there means

80
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:29,932
simply adding your charming touch to it.

81
00:03:29,957 --> 00:03:34,455
It's like upgrading the illustration's appeal.

82
00:03:36,247 --> 00:03:38,397
So, there are times when the volume changes

83
00:03:38,408 --> 00:03:41,437
when describing different types of materials.

84
00:03:41,593 --> 00:03:45,258
When you did your best to describe the material and the lighting effects disappeared,

85
00:03:45,447 --> 00:03:47,304
and when you're not sure what to do,

86
00:03:47,315 --> 00:03:50,296
I think it's better to prioritize the feeling of light,

87
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,415
for most people.

88
00:03:53,538 --> 00:03:57,034
Of course, there are illustrations where the lighting is not that important.

89
00:03:57,059 --> 00:03:58,718
Like now, for the illustrations set in an evening background,

90
00:03:58,742 --> 00:04:00,116
the lighting is quite important.

91
00:04:01,806 --> 00:04:03,056
If the illustration is set in a daytime background,

92
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,377
and if you want the character's skin to be shown well,

93
00:04:06,402 --> 00:04:09,019
when you draw something that's focused on the texture,

94
00:04:10,758 --> 00:04:11,817
in that case,

95
00:04:11,828 --> 00:04:14,645
it's more important to describe the texture.

96
00:04:18,102 --> 00:04:20,216
So, the order of importance may change.

97
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:23,686
I want to explain again

98
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:25,142
about texture-oriented drawings.

99
00:04:27,844 --> 00:04:30,677
Basically, when you draw a picture, and when you color it,

100
00:04:30,702 --> 00:04:33,092
there are people who focus on the volume,

101
00:04:33,116 --> 00:04:35,202
and there are people who focus on the texture.

102
00:04:35,971 --> 00:04:37,928
For those who think light is more important,

103
00:04:37,952 --> 00:04:40,024
they tend to focus more on drawing accurately.

104
00:04:41,141 --> 00:04:42,993
So, these people tend to

105
00:04:43,587 --> 00:04:46,484
focus on the volume.

106
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:47,516
Most of the time.

107
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,647
For those who put an emphasis on the texture,

108
00:04:49,672 --> 00:04:51,827
they usually focus more on the Pen Touch,

109
00:04:52,285 --> 00:04:57,119
and unique touches and description of textures.

110
00:04:57,207 --> 00:04:59,330
They focus more on those things

111
00:04:59,691 --> 00:05:01,691
and they show the charm of each texture

112
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:05,335
the way they like.

113
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:07,695
So, these people focus on texture a lot.

114
00:05:07,946 --> 00:05:12,012
For those who want simple illustrations, they use the latter method.

115
00:05:12,382 --> 00:05:16,171
For those who want to go for

116
00:05:16,196 --> 00:05:17,772
detailed illustrations,

117
00:05:17,797 --> 00:05:19,321
they tend to use the former method.

118
00:05:19,657 --> 00:05:22,443
So, it's important to set the direction and start working.

119
00:05:22,454 --> 00:05:23,458
I think it's okay.

120
00:05:23,469 --> 00:05:25,195
If your current drawing is

121
00:05:25,219 --> 00:05:27,761
focused more on the overall atmosphere

122
00:05:28,218 --> 00:05:31,627
so that it needs some natural lighting,

123
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:33,768
at times,

124
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:36,092
if you're drawing a sexy illustration

125
00:05:36,117 --> 00:05:37,999
your goal may be just showing off the character well.

126
00:05:38,164 --> 00:05:41,421
So, you might not really need the accuracy of lighting in this situation.

127
00:05:41,445 --> 00:05:43,608
In that case, you can focus on the texture.

128
00:05:43,618 --> 00:05:46,748
I think it's good to change it according to the situation.

129
00:05:46,772 --> 00:05:47,881
It's critical.

130
00:05:50,353 --> 00:05:53,553
For the touch-up, I'm going to paint one part.

131
00:05:55,082 --> 00:05:57,012
So, there are bright and dark areas.

132
00:05:57,037 --> 00:05:59,334
You can color the areas in between.

133
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,517
Dab it in.

134
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:05,535
By repeating this, you can make a gradation.

135
00:06:05,636 --> 00:06:08,220
Press Alt to use the Eyedropper Tool.

136
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:13,875
I'll use the Eyedropper Tool and apply it over and over again.

137
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:18,225
The process of making gradation is usually used for coloring.

138
00:06:18,235 --> 00:06:21,678
But if you're not used to touching,

139
00:06:21,703 --> 00:06:26,572
obviously, there will be many small touches left during the gradation process.

140
00:06:26,597 --> 00:06:27,914
The picture will get filthy.

141
00:06:27,938 --> 00:06:29,780
So in order to avoid that,

142
00:06:29,805 --> 00:06:32,645
if you're having a hard time, you can use the Airbrush.

143
00:06:33,421 --> 00:06:35,954
But if you use the Airbrush too much,

144
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:38,048
the lighting could become awkward

145
00:06:38,092 --> 00:06:41,288
For example, the light could be too white,

146
00:06:41,312 --> 00:06:44,207
so you should avoid that.

147
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:46,125
The way I recommend it is

148
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,772
using the Lasso Tool

149
00:06:47,796 --> 00:06:50,450
to choose the areas that you're going to paint.

150
00:06:50,474 --> 00:06:52,758
Then, use an airbrush to apply it gently.

151
00:06:52,895 --> 00:06:55,599
I recommend this for beginners.

152
00:06:58,321 --> 00:07:00,748
Don't forget to color the edges.

153
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,305
At the boundary between the light and shadow, the tone in between these areas

154
00:07:04,394 --> 00:07:07,403
should be connected when you see it in black and white.

155
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:13,802
We're going to apply the density in this illustration.

156
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:17,949
This character's design is quite simple.

157
00:07:17,973 --> 00:07:21,424
So when it comes to expressing the overall mood of the illustration,

158
00:07:21,448 --> 00:07:24,299
it's an illustration that can be described a lot.

159
00:07:24,535 --> 00:07:27,609
Let's think about the appropriate points to increase the amount of description.

160
00:07:27,853 --> 00:07:29,214
Basically, people's eyes

161
00:07:29,238 --> 00:07:32,254
follow the boundary

162
00:07:32,278 --> 00:07:33,287
between the light and the shadow.

163
00:07:33,434 --> 00:07:37,275
So the fact that there are countless descriptions in this section

164
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,903
in the area where people can see thing clearly,

165
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,996
it means that people can feast their eyes on it.

166
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:44,501
When that happens,

167
00:07:44,511 --> 00:07:46,778
it will be very attractive for the viewers.

168
00:07:47,311 --> 00:07:51,081
In other words, the areas that you should focus on when describing things

169
00:07:51,113 --> 00:07:53,533
is the boundary between the light and shadow.

170
00:07:53,883 --> 00:07:57,190
To increase the density of this area,

171
00:07:57,214 --> 00:07:59,690
I'll stretch out the hair a lot.

172
00:08:02,654 --> 00:08:05,727
The more you stretch, the more detailed the description becomes.

173
00:08:07,405 --> 00:08:11,011
Even if I didn't describe the shadowy area,

174
00:08:12,597 --> 00:08:15,436
it looks like the quality of the whole picture has increased.

175
00:08:17,815 --> 00:08:20,978
Since shadows receive less light,

176
00:08:21,002 --> 00:08:23,170
what happens with the contrast when the light is weak?

177
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,733
I said it would decrease.

178
00:08:24,884 --> 00:08:26,867
Because the contrast decreased due to less light,

179
00:08:26,891 --> 00:08:29,843
the hair won't be described in detail.

180
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:35,000
To give it a three-dimensional effect, I don't really describe

181
00:08:35,025 --> 00:08:36,812
the center part of the object.

182
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,798
It's because when describing,

183
00:08:40,822 --> 00:08:43,163
this area looks as if it's hollowed out.

184
00:08:43,748 --> 00:08:45,371
When there is light and shadow,

185
00:08:45,395 --> 00:08:47,638
it looks like it fell back a bit more.

186
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,124
Then on this side that sticks out,

187
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:51,765
between applying a lot of light and shadow here

188
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,937
and applying a lot of light and shadow at the edge,

189
00:08:54,132 --> 00:08:56,942
I think it's better to apply a lot of light and shadow at the edge.

190
00:08:56,966 --> 00:08:58,189
So, it looks more like it goes backwards.

191
00:08:58,199 --> 00:08:59,832
I'm sure the character would stick out more.

192
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,712
So, for the part that sticks out in the front

193
00:09:01,736 --> 00:09:03,188
I don't really describe it.

194
00:09:05,289 --> 00:09:07,211
For this illustration, we would distribute the density like this.

195
00:09:14,123 --> 00:09:16,530
There's a big shadow in it.

196
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:19,576
The whole area of the character is inside the shadow.

197
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,835
There's one thing to look out for when there's a shadow.

198
00:09:21,859 --> 00:09:24,868
Shadows usually aren't formed in other shadows.

199
00:09:24,892 --> 00:09:26,413
Before we look into this,

200
00:09:26,438 --> 00:09:29,203
let's go over Cast Shadows and Form Shadows

201
00:09:29,227 --> 00:09:30,554
once more.

202
00:09:32,265 --> 00:09:35,145
Basically, Cast Shadows are shadows between objects.

203
00:09:35,169 --> 00:09:37,680
They are shadows that are formed between objects.

204
00:09:37,718 --> 00:09:41,340
For Form Shadows, because of the shape of the object,

205
00:09:41,364 --> 00:09:44,124
there is a dark area between the object.

206
00:09:44,148 --> 00:09:45,358
That's the Form Shadow.

207
00:09:45,705 --> 00:09:48,396
What you need to be careful about is the Cast Shadow.

208
00:09:48,597 --> 00:09:52,482
Shadows between objects are basically formed in two layers?

209
00:09:52,506 --> 00:09:53,537
But why?

210
00:09:57,178 --> 00:09:58,753
Let's say there's an object that looks like this

211
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,139
and there's a stick in between

212
00:10:03,334 --> 00:10:05,123
and there's a square board lying on top.

213
00:10:05,764 --> 00:10:08,345
I put some light from the top.

214
00:10:08,504 --> 00:10:10,599
What would the shadow beneath look like?

215
00:10:11,894 --> 00:10:13,426
It will look like this.

216
00:10:13,698 --> 00:10:15,932
If the light above is really strong,

217
00:10:16,054 --> 00:10:21,409
Let's say this area has 100% brightness and that area has 0% brightness.

218
00:10:23,364 --> 00:10:26,231
In other words, the object is not getting any light.

219
00:10:26,522 --> 00:10:30,003
Then even if there's a big stick in between,

220
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,396
because the light it receives is already 0,

221
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,058
the light that this object receives is 0, so there's no shadow.

222
00:10:39,051 --> 00:10:41,486
Then instead of the light from above,

223
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,455
there's a bit of spatial light around it,

224
00:10:43,479 --> 00:10:44,916
so it's a situation where the light is spreading a little.

225
00:10:44,926 --> 00:10:46,182
Let's say the light is a little weak.

226
00:10:46,381 --> 00:10:48,525
If it's very weak,

227
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:51,700
the light from the top will be around 80,

228
00:10:54,459 --> 00:10:56,735
and this shadow is kind of bright.

229
00:10:56,745 --> 00:10:59,058
If I were to say that the brightness is around 20,

230
00:10:59,082 --> 00:11:02,595
then, the object's shadow could be formed a little.

231
00:11:02,619 --> 00:11:04,276
Because of the light coming from around it,

232
00:11:04,301 --> 00:11:06,828
that's possible, but most of the time,

233
00:11:06,852 --> 00:11:08,314
because of the shadow on top,

234
00:11:08,324 --> 00:11:10,230
it's almost completely covered.

235
00:11:11,206 --> 00:11:13,384
But there are exceptions.

236
00:11:13,584 --> 00:11:17,915
Let's say the shadow that forms look like this

237
00:11:17,926 --> 00:11:20,066
when its brightness is set to 20.

238
00:11:20,275 --> 00:11:21,337
It's blurred.

239
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:23,644
Let's say it looks like this.

240
00:11:23,669 --> 00:11:27,453
If this stick goes down,

241
00:11:27,477 --> 00:11:28,490
then it will become different.

242
00:11:29,643 --> 00:11:32,297
If this stick goes down,

243
00:11:32,322 --> 00:11:35,478
the bottom part of this stick won't get any light

244
00:11:35,502 --> 00:11:36,529
since it's close.

245
00:11:38,336 --> 00:11:40,820
The other areas are receiving 20,

246
00:11:41,156 --> 00:11:43,249
that's the situation, so the shadow

247
00:11:43,273 --> 00:11:44,609
may be formed in two layers.

248
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,127
It's a very limited situation.

249
00:11:47,187 --> 00:11:48,562
So, if this is not the case,

250
00:11:48,586 --> 00:11:50,679
most of the time, there's a single layer of shadow.

251
00:11:51,318 --> 00:11:54,192
Don't use too many layers.

252
00:11:54,217 --> 00:11:57,638
If there are objects that are extremely close to each other,

253
00:11:58,286 --> 00:12:01,093
or if you can't do it without shadows,

254
00:12:01,117 --> 00:12:02,417
if there's an area like that,

255
00:12:02,441 --> 00:12:04,577
you can think of it as keeping it just for those scenarios.

256
00:12:04,602 --> 00:12:08,078
Because of that, the hair strands are closer to each other.

257
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,856
In that case, you need to add a bit of Cast Shadow.

258
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,172
Let's reduce the contrast.

259
00:12:27,369 --> 00:12:28,877
During the color roughing stage,

260
00:12:28,902 --> 00:12:31,635
I've worked on most of the Cast Shadows.

261
00:12:32,271 --> 00:12:34,655
The next thing I need to do today is

262
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:36,580
actually apply the Form Shadows.

263
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,804
As I said before, Form Shadows

264
00:12:39,851 --> 00:12:42,814
have a bright middle area and a dark edge area.

265
00:12:43,025 --> 00:12:44,252
In the end, it's about that.

266
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:47,787
If you maintain that well, Form Shadows

267
00:12:47,811 --> 00:12:49,663
are not that unique.

268
00:12:49,688 --> 00:12:55,777
However, the production changes depending on the texture of the object.

269
00:12:55,878 --> 00:12:59,044
It's a process in which you need to understand the texture.

270
00:12:59,281 --> 00:13:02,958
With hair, we color it in by dividing it.

271
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,175
We're going to divide the dimensions and color it.

272
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,072
For the eyes, let's give

273
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:18,513
a three-dimensional effect,

274
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,515
so you should understand that in goes inwards,

275
00:13:21,526 --> 00:13:23,111
and so we can dig the inside deep,

276
00:13:27,013 --> 00:13:29,923
you need to understand

277
00:13:29,947 --> 00:13:31,033
how an object like that looks like.

278
00:13:31,057 --> 00:13:33,264
That way, you can draw a Form Shadow correctly.

279
00:13:33,275 --> 00:13:35,541
While you're applying the Form Shadow,

280
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,167
if your drawing changes a lot,

281
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,435
you need to observe the shape of the object accurately.

282
00:13:39,459 --> 00:13:41,930
It's good to practice drawing together.

283
00:13:48,422 --> 00:13:50,234
While working on Form Shadows,

284
00:13:50,258 --> 00:13:52,807
I'm going to use the saturation alternately.

285
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,832
I'll tell you about this, too.

286
00:13:54,975 --> 00:13:56,656
Basically, when you go into the description stage,

287
00:13:56,681 --> 00:13:59,911
you will use low and high saturations alternately.

288
00:14:00,062 --> 00:14:02,078
The brightest highlighted part is...

289
00:14:02,102 --> 00:14:04,726
since it's usually in a color that's close to white, it has low saturation.

290
00:14:05,482 --> 00:14:08,035
I'm sure there's a tertiary color around the highlights.

291
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:10,074
Since the tertiary color is applied, it's highly saturated.

292
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,682
After that, there's relatively low saturation.

293
00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:16,970
The darker the shade, the higher the saturation.

294
00:14:17,703 --> 00:14:18,817
Again, high saturation.

295
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:22,208
After the saturation goes up,

296
00:14:22,232 --> 00:14:24,232
there could be some back light.

297
00:14:26,114 --> 00:14:29,187
It's like a Backlight coming from the sky above this eye.

298
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:31,601
If it's a situation where there's Backlight coming in,

299
00:14:31,626 --> 00:14:33,867
this will reduce the saturation.

300
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,798
So most of the time, the order of coloring will be

301
00:14:36,822 --> 00:14:38,929
low saturation, high saturation, low saturation, and high saturation.

302
00:14:38,953 --> 00:14:41,202
You'd use this over and over again.

303
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:55,377
If you dig the eyes deeper than the other sections,

304
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:57,015
the eyes will start to stand out.

305
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:01,508
Let's balance it so that it doesn't go too far.

306
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:31,997
It's a method that's often used to depict hair.

307
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,937
There are many people who create it as if

308
00:15:33,961 --> 00:15:36,263
the skin color is reflected in the hair.

309
00:15:36,288 --> 00:15:37,957
So, the hair looks kind of transparent.

310
00:15:38,578 --> 00:15:41,018
It's nothing much, but can you make that part brighter

311
00:15:41,042 --> 00:15:43,511
by scratching the bottom like this.

312
00:15:44,124 --> 00:15:46,601
It'd be better if you mix in the skin colors.

313
00:15:48,762 --> 00:15:50,542
If you do it like this,

314
00:15:50,566 --> 00:15:53,675
the dimensional effect of the hair actually decreases.

315
00:15:53,982 --> 00:15:56,437
Objects are basically dark at the bottom.

316
00:15:56,518 --> 00:15:59,054
It needs to be dark down here.

317
00:15:59,078 --> 00:16:00,885
So I'm coloring that section brightly.

318
00:16:00,909 --> 00:16:02,850
It's a choice that reduces the dimensional effect.

319
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:04,576
You might question whether it's good or not.

320
00:16:04,601 --> 00:16:06,311
Actually, the dimensional effect of the casual character

321
00:16:06,335 --> 00:16:07,983
is not that necessary.

322
00:16:08,144 --> 00:16:09,978
In a bad way, that's what happens

323
00:16:09,988 --> 00:16:12,112
if it's less dimensional.

324
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:15,243
If you make it nicely, it means that the illustration becomes transparent.

325
00:16:18,072 --> 00:16:20,478
If you want to draw a transparent picture, it means that you need to be able to

326
00:16:20,503 --> 00:16:23,703
intentionally break the three-dimensional effect.

327
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:28,660
Because of that, if you like detailed coloring,

328
00:16:28,719 --> 00:16:31,984
or if you like strong and accurate coloring,

329
00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:35,302
it's effective to make the bottom of your hair darker.

330
00:16:35,581 --> 00:16:37,275
If you like transparent coloring,

331
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,883
it looks sentimental and transparent.

332
00:16:41,591 --> 00:16:42,643
So,

333
00:16:42,654 --> 00:16:45,990
if you like transparent coloring,

334
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,782
you can compare it to oil painting and watercolor painting.

335
00:16:49,869 --> 00:16:52,508
If you like watercolor paintings,

336
00:16:52,532 --> 00:16:55,576
you can make the bottom part of the hair brighter

337
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,226
to break the three-dimensional effects.

338
00:16:58,593 --> 00:17:01,272
You can add a transparent look to the entire painting.

339
00:17:10,803 --> 00:17:13,224
I'm going to describe the inside of its mouth, too.

340
00:17:14,321 --> 00:17:16,940
I'll add the shadow that forms because of the teeth.

341
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:29,049
I'm going to add in shadows that form because of the head.

342
00:17:29,576 --> 00:17:32,063
Like this, you can focus on

343
00:17:32,073 --> 00:17:33,566
the Cast Shadow and Form Shadow.

344
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,901
If you describe it,

345
00:17:34,926 --> 00:17:37,021
the quality of your illustration will go up.

346
00:17:37,178 --> 00:17:39,147
Let's say we've done it up to here.

347
00:17:39,172 --> 00:17:41,812
Under the premise that we've done more than this

348
00:17:44,278 --> 00:17:47,034
to improve the quality of the drawing,

349
00:17:47,058 --> 00:17:48,167
there's something more we can do.

350
00:17:48,547 --> 00:17:51,087
It's called the Occlusion Shadow.

351
00:17:52,588 --> 00:17:54,094
Occlusion Shadow is

352
00:17:54,485 --> 00:17:57,129
when the distance between objects is close to zero,

353
00:17:57,154 --> 00:18:02,271
we call them dark shadows, or closed shadows.

354
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:05,917
The hair and skin are almost stuck together.

355
00:18:05,942 --> 00:18:07,308
In this situation, in between,

356
00:18:07,332 --> 00:18:09,361
it's really hard for the light to come in.

357
00:18:09,386 --> 00:18:11,641
The color itself becomes close to a black color.

358
00:18:11,871 --> 00:18:13,597
Whether we have two white objects stuck together,

359
00:18:13,621 --> 00:18:15,427
or whether we have two black objects stuck together,

360
00:18:15,451 --> 00:18:18,159
there's no light between the objects,

361
00:18:18,183 --> 00:18:19,605
so it's always black.

362
00:18:20,592 --> 00:18:23,807
So, if you add shadow to that part,

363
00:18:23,831 --> 00:18:25,697
the quality of the illustration definitely goes up.

364
00:18:25,721 --> 00:18:27,386
Occlusion Shadow,

365
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,471
or Ambient Occlusion,

366
00:18:29,496 --> 00:18:32,199
it's a term that's used often in 3D games.

367
00:18:32,614 --> 00:18:35,047
The reason why it's used a lot in 3D games is

368
00:18:35,071 --> 00:18:38,159
one of the options to make the graphics look better is

369
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:39,510
by using Ambient Occlusion.

370
00:18:40,013 --> 00:18:42,426
So there's a huge difference in quality

371
00:18:42,451 --> 00:18:45,253
depending on whether Ambient Occlusion is included or not.

372
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,760
It's the same thing with illustrations.

373
00:18:47,933 --> 00:18:49,806
If you use Ambient Occlusions,

374
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,642
the overall visual quality will go up.

375
00:18:57,272 --> 00:18:59,775
It's good to see this part clearly,

376
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:00,939
so it'd be nice if you could describe it a little bit.

377
00:19:04,162 --> 00:19:06,965
So, if you include the Ambient Occlusion as well,

378
00:19:06,989 --> 00:19:09,081
the visual quality of the picture goes up a lot.

379
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,603
So it feels more like it's being wrapped up.

380
00:19:11,627 --> 00:19:14,834
Because of that, if you added light and shadow during the coloring process,

381
00:19:14,858 --> 00:19:17,292
if you don't think your illustration is perfect,

382
00:19:17,317 --> 00:19:18,924
pay attention to Ambient Occlusion,

383
00:19:18,948 --> 00:19:20,244
and apply it.

384
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:21,674
If you apply this,

385
00:19:21,698 --> 00:19:24,049
the quality of your illustration might suddenly go up a lot.

386
00:19:25,556 --> 00:19:26,558
So, let's summarize.

387
00:19:26,569 --> 00:19:29,627
Let's talk about what we covered today.

388
00:19:29,886 --> 00:19:31,285
What was the first thing you did?

389
00:19:31,507 --> 00:19:34,446
The first thing I did was to distribute the density of the description.

390
00:19:35,328 --> 00:19:39,705
When you're distributing density to the section where the attention is focused,

391
00:19:39,729 --> 00:19:41,988
describe it a lot and balance it out.

392
00:19:43,354 --> 00:19:47,407
I also talked about how to touch up your illustrations.

393
00:19:47,879 --> 00:19:50,724
I talked about how to make them transparent, too.

394
00:19:50,748 --> 00:19:53,018
I also told you how to distinguish

395
00:19:53,042 --> 00:19:53,815
between Cast Shadow and Form Shadow.

396
00:19:53,962 --> 00:19:57,440
And I also explained an example

397
00:19:57,464 --> 00:19:59,341
with two layers of Cast Shadow.

398
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,845
This case is very special.

399
00:20:00,869 --> 00:20:03,742
In most cases, Cast Shadows don't form in two layers.

400
00:20:03,766 --> 00:20:04,907
Please remember this.

401
00:20:05,357 --> 00:20:07,182
And I told you how to use Occlusion Shadow

402
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,620
to improve the quality of your drawing.

403
00:20:08,814 --> 00:20:11,104
I also told you how to alternate

404
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:12,377
between low saturations and high saturations.

405
00:20:12,932 --> 00:20:15,326
Let's continue to recognize them.

406
00:20:33,921 --> 00:20:35,299
Even in places like this,

407
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:39,823
don't forget to apply Cast Shadow one by one.

408
00:20:40,769 --> 00:20:42,424
I told you it's easy to forget

409
00:20:42,448 --> 00:20:44,406
Cast Shadows while working on your illustrations.

410
00:20:44,431 --> 00:20:47,308
Let's be careful not to forget and take care with each of them.

411
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:53,203
I often paint the edges of my eyes red.

412
00:20:53,736 --> 00:20:55,426
I think that looks prettier.

413
00:20:55,818 --> 00:20:57,487
This is a little personal.

414
00:20:58,042 --> 00:20:59,565
Make it different depending on your preferences.

415
00:21:03,482 --> 00:21:05,174
When you are coloring,

416
00:21:05,198 --> 00:21:06,903
and if you want to improve the quality,

417
00:21:06,927 --> 00:21:08,607
there's another way to use it.

418
00:21:08,631 --> 00:21:10,696
It's coloring the lines.

419
00:21:11,066 --> 00:21:14,389
In the end, lines are all black.

420
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:16,454
This is also something very important.

421
00:21:16,464 --> 00:21:17,904
Lines are made up of colors too.

422
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:21,905
So, the thicker the line,

423
00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:24,728
the colors naturally darken in that section.

424
00:21:25,306 --> 00:21:28,565
Because of that, if it's a character

425
00:21:28,589 --> 00:21:29,898
that's mainly white,

426
00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:33,088
it's good to make the lines

427
00:21:33,112 --> 00:21:34,358
be painted bright or thin.

428
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,323
The thinner the line,

429
00:21:36,347 --> 00:21:38,292
the less attention you have to pay for the line color.

430
00:21:38,316 --> 00:21:40,957
For those of you who think your lines are thick,

431
00:21:40,981 --> 00:21:44,239
there are a lot of times when the color is applied to this line.

432
00:21:44,263 --> 00:21:46,051
Then, that would look prettier.

433
00:21:46,376 --> 00:21:49,397
So, depending on the color of the light,

434
00:21:49,421 --> 00:21:51,881
if you apply red and orange colors

435
00:21:51,905 --> 00:21:53,826
into this area,

436
00:21:54,196 --> 00:21:56,345
you'll be able to add more three-dimensional effects.

437
00:22:00,431 --> 00:22:04,900
The property of the current line Layer is supposed to be Multiply.

438
00:22:05,829 --> 00:22:07,379
The reason why I set it like that

439
00:22:07,403 --> 00:22:09,801
is to ensure smooth connection

440
00:22:09,825 --> 00:22:10,865
with the lower layer.

441
00:22:10,877 --> 00:22:12,207
If this is set to Normal,

442
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:14,457
the orange part will start to stand out.

443
00:22:15,394 --> 00:22:18,262
If you apply Multiply, you can see through the bottom touch-up

444
00:22:18,286 --> 00:22:19,535
and it blends in a bit better.

445
00:22:19,782 --> 00:22:22,400
I express it a lot by applying Multiply to the line Layer.

446
00:22:34,974 --> 00:22:37,025
Let's continue with the description.

447
00:22:37,967 --> 00:22:41,618
Today's goal is to draw it up to this shoulder

448
00:22:43,386 --> 00:22:45,245
within an hour.

449
00:22:45,269 --> 00:22:47,613
I can't show you all the descriptions.

450
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:50,711
Today's content on description

451
00:22:51,532 --> 00:22:54,548
is more focused on the contents.

452
00:22:54,711 --> 00:22:57,769
When I work on portrait illustrations later,

453
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:01,509
I'm going to show you how I describe them.

454
00:23:01,534 --> 00:23:09,263
At that time, I will work on it

455
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:10,814
as I dub in the process video.

456
00:23:11,966 --> 00:23:15,052
I'll upload the video then.

457
00:23:15,076 --> 00:23:17,168
So while watching the process of myself working on it,

458
00:23:17,193 --> 00:23:19,158
I think it would be good to observe a bit more

459
00:23:19,193 --> 00:23:21,522
how the description goes.

460
00:23:25,878 --> 00:23:30,355
The one-hour description that I'm doing right now

461
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:33,121
is in the same order I usually work.

462
00:23:35,855 --> 00:23:38,842
In the end, I kept repeating them from top to bottom

463
00:23:38,853 --> 00:23:39,857
while coloring.

464
00:23:42,899 --> 00:23:46,517
There's nothing special about coloring.

465
00:23:52,905 --> 00:23:54,760
In the end, coloring is not so much about

466
00:23:54,784 --> 00:23:58,194
doing challenging coloring with intent,

467
00:23:58,327 --> 00:24:00,963
but being more natural at it

468
00:24:00,987 --> 00:24:03,136
as you go through the process of coloring.

469
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,610
If haven't formed your own personality,

470
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:11,567
there are people who value individuality when it comes to coloring.

471
00:24:11,891 --> 00:24:13,832
But don't worry too much.

472
00:24:13,856 --> 00:24:17,615
Most people don't make their own personalities based on their own intentions.

473
00:24:18,393 --> 00:24:20,468
If you just draw, you will eventually find it.

474
00:24:21,834 --> 00:24:23,834
It's hard to find someone who doesn't have a personality.

475
00:24:23,858 --> 00:24:26,025
Most of them have their own individuality.

476
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:29,655
It's just that if it's not fully reinforced, people can't always see it.

477
00:24:29,918 --> 00:24:32,465
So, if the drawing lacks individuality,

478
00:24:32,489 --> 00:24:34,181
and if you're concerned about that,

479
00:24:34,205 --> 00:24:36,205
you will be under a lot of stress.

480
00:24:36,229 --> 00:24:39,238
But, I think you don't have to be stressed out that much.

481
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:43,087
It's simply because it's less skillfully refined.

482
00:24:43,781 --> 00:24:45,379
If you work hard,

483
00:24:45,403 --> 00:24:47,111
as it gets more refined,

484
00:24:47,121 --> 00:24:49,065
it'll gradually become your own personality.

485
00:24:51,579 --> 00:24:54,035
In the end, individuality is based on the points that you like.

486
00:24:54,735 --> 00:24:58,594
The things you like

487
00:24:58,618 --> 00:25:00,613
later form your individuality.

488
00:25:03,439 --> 00:25:06,379
So, if you don't know what personality is,

489
00:25:06,403 --> 00:25:07,738
if you're one of those people,

490
00:25:07,763 --> 00:25:10,222
it's good to think about what you like.

491
00:25:14,122 --> 00:25:16,377
It's important to have clear preferences

492
00:25:16,401 --> 00:25:19,542
when you continue working.

493
00:25:19,877 --> 00:25:21,379
I think that's the key point.

494
00:25:21,403 --> 00:25:23,702
It's super important.

495
00:25:24,131 --> 00:25:26,586
When you're studying illustration,

496
00:25:26,883 --> 00:25:28,827
it's important to establish your preferences.

497
00:25:29,218 --> 00:25:31,921
I think this is a must-do process.

498
00:25:32,382 --> 00:25:35,040
Even if we are playing a game,

499
00:25:35,065 --> 00:25:36,619
there would be character preferences.

500
00:25:36,949 --> 00:25:40,436
You might like aggressive characters or defensive characters.

501
00:25:40,461 --> 00:25:43,186
You might like supporters or leaders.

502
00:25:43,287 --> 00:25:44,921
You will have such preferences.

503
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,847
It's like that when you're playing games.

504
00:25:46,871 --> 00:25:48,837
And it's the same for drawing.

505
00:25:51,922 --> 00:25:53,806
There's bound to be a character that you prefer.

506
00:25:53,816 --> 00:25:55,514
Your preferred character's characteristics

507
00:25:55,539 --> 00:25:57,701
are usually ones that you're good at.

508
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,882
So, your preferences are

509
00:25:59,906 --> 00:26:03,613
a factor that indirectly show your strengths and weaknesses.

510
00:26:03,892 --> 00:26:07,619
So, let's clarify our preferences and show our strengths and weaknesses.

511
00:26:08,011 --> 00:26:11,884
I'm telling you that it's important to find them out.

512
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,373
I'll add some highlights to the teeth.

513
00:26:14,397 --> 00:26:16,331
I'll put in some shiny material.

514
00:26:22,896 --> 00:26:24,998
I'll keep checking the black and white in between

515
00:26:25,022 --> 00:26:26,837
to see if there are any differences in the overall tone.

516
00:26:26,861 --> 00:26:30,113
I'll observe if there's anything that stands out.

517
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,931
Let's also describe the cracks on the hat.

518
00:26:54,991 --> 00:26:56,293
The shadow is now

519
00:26:56,317 --> 00:26:59,098
far apart from the hair.

520
00:27:00,528 --> 00:27:01,783
We're going to go into detail

521
00:27:01,807 --> 00:27:03,921
about Cast Shadows.

522
00:27:03,945 --> 00:27:06,409
The farther away the Cast Shadow gets,

523
00:27:06,433 --> 00:27:08,899
the more the shadows will grow and spread.

524
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,514
So let's say the object up there is on this street.

525
00:27:13,762 --> 00:27:15,762
If there's a shadow underneath,

526
00:27:15,777 --> 00:27:18,693
the further the distance is, the lighter the shadow is.

527
00:27:19,034 --> 00:27:20,802
It also spreads widely.

528
00:27:21,041 --> 00:27:23,430
Of course, the edges are a bit messy, too.

529
00:27:23,454 --> 00:27:25,242
This is how shadows form.

530
00:27:28,996 --> 00:27:30,565
So right now,

531
00:27:30,589 --> 00:27:32,910
with the hair on this side, which is quite far away from this hair,

532
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:35,223
the shadow will widen to a certain extent.

533
00:27:35,262 --> 00:27:37,162
At that time, I'll use the tertiary colors

534
00:27:39,331 --> 00:27:41,613
and I'm going to spread them.

535
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:50,520
If I show that the shadow is spreading,

536
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,837
I can make it look pretty.

537
00:27:53,391 --> 00:27:55,843
There was a metal material for this one.

538
00:27:56,527 --> 00:27:58,613
We're going to talk about the characteristics of each material.

539
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:01,700
The top part of the hair has huge contrast.

540
00:28:01,724 --> 00:28:02,874
So let's add some highlights.

541
00:28:02,908 --> 00:28:04,535
I drew the teeth in.

542
00:28:05,409 --> 00:28:08,540
When it comes to contrast,

543
00:28:08,564 --> 00:28:09,714
literally,

544
00:28:09,738 --> 00:28:12,577
if this character shines, the contrast is strong.

545
00:28:12,601 --> 00:28:15,284
If this character is a bit soft,

546
00:28:15,308 --> 00:28:16,999
you can think of it having a weak contrast.

547
00:28:17,174 --> 00:28:19,931
But that's not what's important.

548
00:28:19,955 --> 00:28:23,514
You have to decide on your own

549
00:28:23,538 --> 00:28:25,212
to see which one has the biggest contrast.

550
00:28:25,344 --> 00:28:28,150
Which has stronger contrast, the hair or the teeth?

551
00:28:28,391 --> 00:28:31,530
And I'll organize them based on the order of which is stronger in

552
00:28:31,555 --> 00:28:34,686
the contrast between the teeth and the metal.

553
00:28:34,845 --> 00:28:37,978
The reason why I organize that is because when it comes to directing,

554
00:28:38,002 --> 00:28:41,056
or when it comes to the base colors, it provides some differences.

555
00:28:41,298 --> 00:28:45,707
With the base colors of the material with a large contrast and a light contrast,

556
00:28:45,985 --> 00:28:48,874
the material with a large contrast is dark.

557
00:28:48,991 --> 00:28:52,610
So metal has a high contrast, and fabric has a low contrast.

558
00:28:53,067 --> 00:28:56,499
So even if I put white metal in here,

559
00:28:56,524 --> 00:28:58,109
I'll put in gray this much.

560
00:28:59,116 --> 00:29:00,428
When we add highlights,

561
00:29:00,452 --> 00:29:02,600
if you put it in like this, it looks like white metal.

562
00:29:03,297 --> 00:29:05,085
So, the material with big contrast is

563
00:29:05,109 --> 00:29:06,522
the part that doesn't get light

564
00:29:06,546 --> 00:29:09,134
since it clearly becomes dark.

565
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:10,604
When you apply the base tone,

566
00:29:10,628 --> 00:29:12,519
it's important to make it darker.

567
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:15,110
There's a dark gray area here.

568
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:18,101
I can add white to it here.

569
00:29:18,126 --> 00:29:20,987
Let's make it strong in the areas where the light comes in.

570
00:29:21,955 --> 00:29:25,002
It's important to give a clear contrast with the other sections.

571
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:32,215
That way, with the highlighted areas,

572
00:29:32,256 --> 00:29:35,323
you'll feel like it's metal.

573
00:30:13,796 --> 00:30:17,120
Since this side is close to the shadow, I'll color it in darker.

574
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:31,126
Things like hair descriptions

575
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:33,695
should be focused on the edges as much as possible.

576
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:36,693
Let's focus on the dark areas.

577
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:40,999
That's how this will act as the Form Shadow.

578
00:30:47,717 --> 00:30:50,934
Don't forget to add Cast Shadow to the inside of the hair.

579
00:30:51,777 --> 00:30:54,298
If you take care with Occlusion Shadow,

580
00:30:54,322 --> 00:30:56,598
the quality of the illustration keeps going up.

581
00:31:45,315 --> 00:31:48,314
I'm going to clean up the description like this.

582
00:31:50,081 --> 00:31:51,993
Let's come back to density distribution.

583
00:31:52,017 --> 00:31:54,599
We're going to focus on the density distribution.

584
00:31:54,657 --> 00:31:56,169
If you look here, in the upper section,

585
00:31:56,193 --> 00:31:58,570
you'll see that the description is focused quite a lot.

586
00:31:59,683 --> 00:32:00,928
That means

587
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:03,800
there's a lot of description in the part where the attention is focused.

588
00:32:03,824 --> 00:32:05,184
Then to put it the other way around,

589
00:32:05,194 --> 00:32:07,324
how would you go in when you go into the description?

590
00:32:07,348 --> 00:32:08,987
The parts that need less description

591
00:32:09,067 --> 00:32:12,467
these sections are effective if you use the lighting together.

592
00:32:12,492 --> 00:32:13,985
The light that's coming in right now

593
00:32:14,009 --> 00:32:15,861
is coming from the top left of the character.

594
00:32:16,024 --> 00:32:19,030
Which means it's coming from the back of its face.

595
00:32:20,047 --> 00:32:22,073
From the perspective of the body, the light...

596
00:32:22,097 --> 00:32:24,384
From the perspective of the body that's under the face,

597
00:32:24,408 --> 00:32:27,009
it's not that different from the light from above.

598
00:32:27,061 --> 00:32:30,123
So when you depict the belts underneath,

599
00:32:30,147 --> 00:32:32,704
think of the light coming from above.

600
00:32:32,728 --> 00:32:35,121
You need to make the top part shine.

601
00:32:35,574 --> 00:32:37,894
I'm going to paint the side that I'm looking up to make it bright.

602
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:39,757
And then,

603
00:32:39,781 --> 00:32:42,599
what should I do with the front side that doesn't get any light?

604
00:32:43,065 --> 00:32:44,212
I'm not going to describe it.

605
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:48,418
I'm really not going to.

606
00:32:49,174 --> 00:32:51,329
Yes, it's okay to do that.

607
00:32:51,417 --> 00:32:54,148
We already focused on

608
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:56,503
the facial area, which we wanted to show.

609
00:32:56,527 --> 00:32:59,311
So, it's best not to describe the rest of the sections.

610
00:32:59,403 --> 00:33:02,118
This is one of the most important parts of description.

611
00:33:02,393 --> 00:33:04,997
It's the most important point when it comes to the concept of description.

612
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,749
Usually,

613
00:33:06,773 --> 00:33:09,253
students work on a piece by describing it a lot.

614
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:11,806
If you describe it more, the quality will go up.

615
00:33:12,086 --> 00:33:13,165
That's not wrong.

616
00:33:13,176 --> 00:33:14,048
If you describe it a lot,

617
00:33:14,072 --> 00:33:16,067
of course, the quality can be improved.

618
00:33:16,092 --> 00:33:18,707
But distribution is a little more important.

619
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,471
Rather than adding a lot of description,

620
00:33:20,495 --> 00:33:22,803
it's much more effective to distribute the description well.

621
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:27,104
There needs to be a difference

622
00:33:29,011 --> 00:33:30,789
for the parts that have a lot of description.

623
00:33:30,972 --> 00:33:34,365
For example, if you describe 10 in this section,

624
00:33:34,394 --> 00:33:36,306
and if you describe 5 in this section,

625
00:33:36,923 --> 00:33:40,065
and if you describe 6 in this section,

626
00:33:40,089 --> 00:33:42,134
this section will be described as 1.

627
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,403
There's a slight difference in quality between the two,

628
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,799
but when it comes to the final result,

629
00:33:46,823 --> 00:33:49,309
if you ask which one is better, I think both are good.

630
00:33:49,771 --> 00:33:51,714
It's because it's well distributed.

631
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,337
In the worst scenario,

632
00:33:53,361 --> 00:33:55,681
you might try your best to describe it

633
00:33:55,705 --> 00:33:57,972
and describe things here and there.

634
00:33:57,997 --> 00:34:00,915
7, 6, 5, 4, 7... Like this.

635
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:02,600
The descriptions are all distributed.

636
00:34:02,844 --> 00:34:06,309
There's probably a limit

637
00:34:06,475 --> 00:34:07,920
when you're describing.

638
00:34:07,944 --> 00:34:10,537
There's a limit to the quality that you can raise it.

639
00:34:10,561 --> 00:34:12,750
Let's save the upper limit and use it.

640
00:34:13,181 --> 00:34:14,321
I'll just keep it.

641
00:34:14,345 --> 00:34:17,004
I'm going to focus on the parts that I need.

642
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:20,059
If you worked really hard on it,

643
00:34:20,084 --> 00:34:23,506
for the rest of the areas, don't worry about it and don't describe them.

644
00:34:24,836 --> 00:34:26,421
For your information, it's harder to not do it.

645
00:34:26,455 --> 00:34:28,091
In the process of doing the description,

646
00:34:28,115 --> 00:34:30,420
there are a lot of people who can't stand it and will just describe it.

647
00:34:30,539 --> 00:34:32,346
Or because you were mesmerized,

648
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:34,400
you discovered you could do more than you thought.

649
00:34:34,425 --> 00:34:36,714
I'm sure there are many people who are like this.

650
00:34:36,738 --> 00:34:38,922
Well, we'll just have to do it and erase it.

651
00:34:40,117 --> 00:34:42,239
If you think there's too much to describe,

652
00:34:42,263 --> 00:34:43,931
It's better to make up your mind and erase it.

653
00:34:44,193 --> 00:34:47,108
The more the description is left out,

654
00:34:47,132 --> 00:34:49,309
the more character's face should be described in detail.

655
00:34:49,492 --> 00:34:51,518
The description is only relative.

656
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,609
The section that you designated as the main element.

657
00:34:54,633 --> 00:34:57,031
If there's a lot of descriptions of important parts,

658
00:34:57,055 --> 00:34:59,712
or if you describe them less,

659
00:34:59,737 --> 00:35:00,804
you can describe other places less.

660
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:02,847
And do less for other places.

661
00:35:02,857 --> 00:35:05,323
It's important to make differentiate them.

662
00:35:07,935 --> 00:35:09,771
In a way, when it comes to description,

663
00:35:09,795 --> 00:35:12,204
that's what I wanted to tell you the most.

664
00:35:12,409 --> 00:35:14,303
Cast Shadows and Form Shadows

665
00:35:14,313 --> 00:35:15,363
are theoretical.

666
00:35:15,388 --> 00:35:17,988
What I'm telling you now is not a theory,

667
00:35:18,013 --> 00:35:19,411
but it's more of a sixth sense for

668
00:35:19,435 --> 00:35:20,788
how to create a pretty picture.

669
00:35:22,694 --> 00:35:25,168
Pictures with a lot of descriptions can be pretty, too.

670
00:35:25,193 --> 00:35:27,299
Paintings that don't have descriptions can be pretty, too.

671
00:35:27,556 --> 00:35:30,311
When we see animated films, we think they're pretty.

672
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:32,480
Why are those pictures so pretty?

673
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,207
There are sections that need to be focused on.

674
00:35:34,231 --> 00:35:36,807
The character's eyes are always filled with sparkles.

675
00:35:37,899 --> 00:35:40,782
If you look at pretty characters in animation,

676
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:43,182
they're always very detailed in description,

677
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:46,931
and there are times when there are sparkles in the character's eyes.

678
00:35:46,976 --> 00:35:48,233
That's the same.

679
00:35:48,258 --> 00:35:50,246
There's not much description of the other sections.

680
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:52,193
I'm going to draw in the eye area.

681
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:54,789
To make the eyes stand out from the perspective of the viewers,

682
00:35:55,134 --> 00:35:58,713
making the eyes stand out means the character will look pretty.

683
00:35:59,109 --> 00:36:01,004
When I talked about the face description,

684
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:03,084
when the description is focused

685
00:36:03,108 --> 00:36:05,679
and if the facial area can be more focused,

686
00:36:05,704 --> 00:36:07,234
we can look at the animation

687
00:36:07,258 --> 00:36:08,520
and feel that it is pretty.

688
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:12,184
That's why there are people who are describing it here and there

689
00:36:12,208 --> 00:36:14,278
to try to improve the quality.

690
00:36:14,303 --> 00:36:15,403
But please stop that.

691
00:36:15,947 --> 00:36:18,459
You have to draw the parts that have been highlighted.

692
00:36:18,483 --> 00:36:19,635
Make sure you do it well.

693
00:36:19,659 --> 00:36:21,701
Please don't describe the other areas in detail.

694
00:36:22,188 --> 00:36:25,603
When it comes to making a prettier illustration,

695
00:36:25,627 --> 00:36:27,816
I emphasize that it's a necessary process for this part.

696
00:36:38,881 --> 00:36:39,986
It's very important.

697
00:36:44,255 --> 00:36:46,481
What we need to do now is

698
00:36:46,505 --> 00:36:48,506
know the limits of description

699
00:36:49,211 --> 00:36:51,075
and when you're describing things clearly,

700
00:36:51,099 --> 00:36:52,612
know how far you should go.

701
00:36:52,637 --> 00:36:53,730
Figure that out.

702
00:36:53,754 --> 00:36:56,153
You need

703
00:36:56,178 --> 00:36:57,375
the ability to adjust it based on the circumstances.

704
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,572
And it'd be nice to raise your limits a bit.

705
00:37:00,596 --> 00:37:03,917
Especially for those who want to do concept art,

706
00:37:03,941 --> 00:37:06,218
and if you want to do in-game illustrations,

707
00:37:06,243 --> 00:37:09,331
there's an advantage if the quality of the picture is high.

708
00:37:09,356 --> 00:37:11,011
You should keep in mind

709
00:37:11,035 --> 00:37:12,625
how to raise the quality.

710
00:37:13,038 --> 00:37:14,617
Raise your limits.

711
00:37:14,789 --> 00:37:16,295
If you try your best,

712
00:37:16,305 --> 00:37:18,111
it could make a big difference.

713
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:20,828
Rather than the difference between 5 and 1,

714
00:37:20,856 --> 00:37:22,712
there's a bigger difference between 10 and 1.

715
00:37:23,191 --> 00:37:26,058
So the process of increasing the amount to 10

716
00:37:26,082 --> 00:37:28,506
is the process of raising the quality of your description.

717
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:30,547
To practice it effectively,

718
00:37:30,571 --> 00:37:32,503
copying would be the best.

719
00:37:32,713 --> 00:37:34,672
Spend a lot of time copying.

720
00:37:34,696 --> 00:37:37,269
I think it would be the best idea to do that.

721
00:37:37,723 --> 00:37:40,710
When it comes to distributing the description, you have to be aware of it.

722
00:37:41,418 --> 00:37:44,656
This isn't really part of the practice, but it's a sensual part.

723
00:37:44,689 --> 00:37:46,696
You should definitely focus on it,

724
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,997
and it's important to think about the description here.

725
00:38:02,087 --> 00:38:04,999
Let's compare what we've done.

726
00:38:05,205 --> 00:38:07,008
Before, and after.

727
00:38:07,288 --> 00:38:08,289
Certainly,

728
00:38:08,313 --> 00:38:10,602
you can see that the face sticks out more.

729
00:38:13,581 --> 00:38:16,093
I'm going to dig deep in the back

730
00:38:16,117 --> 00:38:18,601
and I won't describe the parts that stick out.

731
00:38:18,776 --> 00:38:20,164
While repeating this process,

732
00:38:20,188 --> 00:38:22,000
it's adding three-dimensional effects to the painting.

733
00:38:25,585 --> 00:38:28,897
I want to highlight

734
00:38:28,921 --> 00:38:31,157
the face section and the upper chest section.

735
00:38:31,181 --> 00:38:33,819
I'm going to describe this section clearly.

736
00:38:33,852 --> 00:38:36,101
I'm not going to put creases on the bottom either.

737
00:38:36,203 --> 00:38:37,799
Even if you put them in, put just a little bit in.

738
00:38:38,148 --> 00:38:39,387
Only around one or two.

739
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:43,295
I think it'll be okay if there's some creases in the lower section.

740
00:38:48,795 --> 00:38:53,798
You can balance between strong, weak, and medium.

741
00:38:53,978 --> 00:38:56,619
This is kind of like a tempo adjustment.

742
00:38:57,107 --> 00:38:59,683
It's the tempo that you use to divide the weight of your drawing.

743
00:38:59,708 --> 00:39:01,753
Let me give you a tip.

744
00:39:01,777 --> 00:39:03,385
It's good to use it alternately.

745
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:04,456
What I'm saying is,

746
00:39:04,466 --> 00:39:08,190
if you do it in the order of strong, medium, and weak,

747
00:39:08,214 --> 00:39:10,859
this can also feel too regular.

748
00:39:10,883 --> 00:39:12,912
So the illustration will get boring.

749
00:39:12,978 --> 00:39:14,728
So when you distribute the density...

750
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:17,157
Strong, weak, medium.

751
00:39:17,182 --> 00:39:19,522
If you mix strong and medium,

752
00:39:19,546 --> 00:39:21,903
you can make the drawing look more witty.

753
00:39:21,927 --> 00:39:24,494
The drawing will look more fun.

754
00:39:28,098 --> 00:39:30,018
It's good to use it when distributing density.

755
00:39:31,191 --> 00:39:33,305
Here, too. As we did before,

756
00:39:34,309 --> 00:39:36,383
I'll strengthen the parts that stick out.

757
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:38,304
That's it. I'm not going to describe it any more.

758
00:39:39,147 --> 00:39:41,021
I really don't describe it after doing this.

759
00:39:41,832 --> 00:39:45,117
You don't need to describe as much as you think.

760
00:39:46,539 --> 00:39:50,131
So if you know where to describe things exactly,

761
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:53,638
the amount of time you need for description

762
00:39:53,648 --> 00:39:54,710
will be reduced.

763
00:39:54,734 --> 00:39:56,922
When your process has been optimized,

764
00:39:56,946 --> 00:39:58,396
drawing one illustration a day

765
00:39:58,424 --> 00:40:00,106
won't be that hard.

766
00:40:03,445 --> 00:40:06,742
That's how your speed will go up.

767
00:40:06,801 --> 00:40:09,012
It's about deleting unnecessary processes in the end.

768
00:40:26,918 --> 00:40:30,188
Since I want to add gradation on this side,

769
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,006
if you're not confident with touching up,

770
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:34,099
use the airbrush to paint the bottom.

771
00:40:42,109 --> 00:40:47,814
If you connect it gently, it becomes easier to describe.

772
00:41:08,867 --> 00:41:09,894
You'll be able to see that I'm describing it

773
00:41:09,918 --> 00:41:11,788
by changing the hues.

774
00:41:11,874 --> 00:41:15,448
It's good that the color doesn't become awkward when you spin it.

775
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,597
Rather than not spinning it.

776
00:41:17,807 --> 00:41:20,505
But it's not like there's no rule to spin this around.

777
00:41:20,643 --> 00:41:24,373
The farther away from the color of the light, the darker the color of the natural brightness.

778
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:25,705
We can change it.

779
00:41:26,114 --> 00:41:27,835
The natural brightness is

780
00:41:27,859 --> 00:41:31,199
the natural brightness of each color.

781
00:41:33,435 --> 00:41:37,101
If you apply yellow on the same spot, it's this much.

782
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:40,630
If you paint the same color with blue, it comes out like this.

783
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:43,082
It doesn't look that different.

784
00:41:43,107 --> 00:41:44,992
If you look at it in black and white, there's a huge difference.

785
00:41:45,016 --> 00:41:46,204
With the difference in brightness,

786
00:41:46,228 --> 00:41:48,208
you can think of it as the intrinsic brightness of each color.

787
00:41:48,233 --> 00:41:51,504
The Eyedropper has the same colors picked, but the brightness is quite different.

788
00:41:51,688 --> 00:41:55,139
So, if the bright part is yellow,

789
00:41:55,164 --> 00:41:57,884
whenever it gets dark, I mix the red colors.

790
00:41:57,908 --> 00:41:59,915
You can think of it as a progression.

791
00:42:03,774 --> 00:42:07,101
I'll tell you this one more time

792
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:08,399
when you draw the portrait illustration later.

793
00:42:09,078 --> 00:42:11,710
It's because the concept of changing colors is

794
00:42:11,791 --> 00:42:13,218
important here.

795
00:42:13,242 --> 00:42:15,825
It's close to a sensual feeling.

796
00:42:16,386 --> 00:42:18,246
If you do something wrong, you might forget.

797
00:42:18,271 --> 00:42:20,271
So you'll need a little reminder from time to time.

798
00:42:20,572 --> 00:42:22,396
If you don't change the color,

799
00:42:23,391 --> 00:42:27,413
and continue drawing,

800
00:42:28,608 --> 00:42:32,221
the illustration will get a bit murky and it's hard to build up a good contrast.

801
00:42:32,246 --> 00:42:34,314
So, you'll end up giving strong contrast.

802
00:42:36,976 --> 00:42:39,544
If you give it a strong contrast, the picture will look like it's burnt.

803
00:42:39,568 --> 00:42:41,289
That happens a lot.

804
00:42:47,388 --> 00:42:49,609
Especially, when you make shadows like this,

805
00:42:49,633 --> 00:42:51,888
the bright part has an orangey color.

806
00:42:51,912 --> 00:42:53,919
If the dark part feels blue,

807
00:42:53,944 --> 00:42:56,494
that alone makes the difference between the two quite big.

808
00:42:56,518 --> 00:42:57,606
There's a difference in color.

809
00:42:57,631 --> 00:43:00,316
So when you look at it in black and white, and even if there's no big difference in the brightness,

810
00:43:00,341 --> 00:43:02,998
you can definitely tell that there's a shadow there.

811
00:43:03,023 --> 00:43:04,582
If we go with the same color,

812
00:43:04,606 --> 00:43:06,354
it's hard to make a difference.

813
00:43:06,378 --> 00:43:09,104
So you would automatically lower this shadow tone

814
00:43:09,284 --> 00:43:11,503
while hoping there would be a big difference.

815
00:43:11,694 --> 00:43:13,518
And in the process, the picture gets burned out.

816
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:15,795
Then, there will be more contrast.

817
00:43:16,906 --> 00:43:18,492
The illustration will get too dark.

818
00:43:21,497 --> 00:43:23,009
To prevent that,

819
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:25,388
I think it's good to keep changing colors.

820
00:43:25,493 --> 00:43:26,829
Take care of that.

821
00:43:57,978 --> 00:43:59,303
Before,

822
00:43:59,405 --> 00:44:00,497
and after.

823
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,986
The quality keeps getting better.

824
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:05,508
You'll be able to see what's going on.

825
00:44:12,262 --> 00:44:14,383
Like this, with the illustration,

826
00:44:14,407 --> 00:44:16,500
we're approaching the completion stage.

827
00:44:16,524 --> 00:44:18,217
Once it's been made,

828
00:44:18,241 --> 00:44:21,313
it's good to check it once in the middle.

829
00:44:21,601 --> 00:44:23,519
Let's see if it's going well.

830
00:44:24,894 --> 00:44:26,698
It's going well as I intended.

831
00:44:26,722 --> 00:44:29,216
It's similar to the first one.

832
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,696
It's good to keep looking at it by turning it off and on.

833
00:44:38,398 --> 00:44:41,091
One of the things that happens a lot when you draw is,

834
00:44:41,115 --> 00:44:43,194
if you were so focused on one part,

835
00:44:43,218 --> 00:44:45,202
you'll forget to describe the other sections.

836
00:44:45,495 --> 00:44:47,509
You have to be careful not to do that.

837
00:44:52,796 --> 00:44:55,520
I'll highlight each eye.

838
00:45:28,606 --> 00:45:32,130
Let's continue to put in Occlusion Shadow to improve the quality.

839
00:45:45,837 --> 00:45:47,215
This Occlusion Shadow,

840
00:45:47,239 --> 00:45:49,619
it acts like a line.

841
00:45:50,355 --> 00:45:53,695
As there's a clear distance between objects,

842
00:45:53,719 --> 00:45:55,017
when this goes in,

843
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:57,900
these are obviously different things.

844
00:45:57,925 --> 00:45:59,494
It serves as a boundary line.

845
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:02,091
Thanks to that, the clarity of the painting increases considerably.

846
00:46:02,235 --> 00:46:05,319
It's actually the most important thing in casual illustrations.

847
00:46:05,343 --> 00:46:07,082
Out of people who are emphasizing that,

848
00:46:07,107 --> 00:46:11,209
some people always emphasize visibility.

849
00:46:13,947 --> 00:46:16,998
Casual illustration is like fast food.

850
00:46:17,684 --> 00:46:20,560
Compared to the realistically drawn illustrations, when you look at it at a glance,

851
00:46:20,589 --> 00:46:22,982
it's important that its charm stands out.

852
00:46:23,006 --> 00:46:24,490
That's what some people say.

853
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:27,287
Visibility is important.

854
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:29,235
The things that I want to show,

855
00:46:29,259 --> 00:46:31,103
it's important to see them at a glance.

856
00:46:31,646 --> 00:46:34,571
So, this Occlusion Shadow,

857
00:46:34,596 --> 00:46:36,623
it's a way to increase visibility

858
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:38,986
so it would be a pretty good fit.

859
00:46:39,091 --> 00:46:42,119
If you use it well, the picture will get clearer.

860
00:46:42,325 --> 00:46:44,002
It makes a strong first impression.

861
00:46:45,216 --> 00:46:48,005
It's easier to see from afar.

862
00:46:48,644 --> 00:46:50,606
But this is very important.

863
00:46:50,652 --> 00:46:52,857
It's because when we're working, right now

864
00:46:52,881 --> 00:46:54,978
we zoom in on this and work on it.

865
00:46:55,002 --> 00:46:56,495
But the people who actually see this painting

866
00:46:56,519 --> 00:46:57,796
will see it in this size.

867
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,275
For those who are looking at it on their phone,

868
00:46:59,299 --> 00:47:00,703
they might see it in this size.

869
00:47:00,727 --> 00:47:02,892
And these people, when they look at a painting,

870
00:47:02,916 --> 00:47:04,595
they won't look at mine for more than 3 seconds.

871
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:07,322
If you look at an illustration, you look at it for a second and 'like' it,

872
00:47:07,346 --> 00:47:09,388
or just pass by. That's how it is in the end.

873
00:47:10,142 --> 00:47:12,542
So in a way, the success or failure of this painting...

874
00:47:12,566 --> 00:47:15,483
It's safe to say that it's determined in the first second.

875
00:47:15,636 --> 00:47:17,291
So when it comes to my first impression,

876
00:47:17,315 --> 00:47:19,456
the Occlusion Shadow that makes the drawing clearer,

877
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:22,006
it plays a very important role.

878
00:47:58,773 --> 00:48:02,321
So when you describe a picture, you have to be very detailed.

879
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:04,185
There are people who say this.

880
00:48:04,398 --> 00:48:05,437
To put it plainly,

881
00:48:05,448 --> 00:48:07,404
you don't have to be as detailed as you might think.

882
00:48:08,641 --> 00:48:11,712
If you think it's okay in 100%.

883
00:48:11,737 --> 00:48:13,302
It's okay to just continue on.

884
00:48:13,524 --> 00:48:15,731
The description needs to be neat.

885
00:48:15,755 --> 00:48:17,322
There can't be anything that's sticking out.

886
00:48:17,346 --> 00:48:18,562
It's not like that.

887
00:48:18,702 --> 00:48:20,358
It's the same when you use it in person.

888
00:48:20,393 --> 00:48:24,406
The images that you thought were in higher quality,

889
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:26,930
if you download them as a PSD file,

890
00:48:26,954 --> 00:48:30,336
there may be a lot of errors if you look at it closely.

891
00:48:30,523 --> 00:48:33,027
As we did before, there are parts where we take a break.

892
00:48:33,051 --> 00:48:35,512
It's used a lot in real life illustrations.

893
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,894
But when you look at it from afar,

894
00:48:37,927 --> 00:48:39,535
so that you can't see those parts from your first impression,

895
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:41,134
it's just that they're well-placed.

896
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:43,190
You don't have to insist

897
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,599
on the quality of the description itself.

898
00:48:46,087 --> 00:48:47,504
So, I hope that's why...

899
00:48:47,528 --> 00:48:49,065
Let's say you're scared of doing description.

900
00:48:49,089 --> 00:48:50,904
There are probably people who can't color it well.

901
00:48:51,981 --> 00:48:54,079
Don't be too scared.

902
00:48:54,103 --> 00:48:55,884
There's no need to be so detailed.

903
00:48:56,197 --> 00:48:58,005
If you're not confident with touching up,

904
00:48:58,030 --> 00:48:59,372
you can use a Lasso Tool.

905
00:48:59,787 --> 00:49:01,392
I'm not confident in taking pictures of colors.

906
00:49:01,416 --> 00:49:02,451
But you can use references.

907
00:49:02,876 --> 00:49:04,802
There's a way out,

908
00:49:06,144 --> 00:49:07,291
in theory.

909
00:49:07,315 --> 00:49:10,123
If you can analyze the data and use it well,

910
00:49:10,148 --> 00:49:11,607
you can draw anything.

911
00:49:12,185 --> 00:49:15,626
Even if you don't draw, if you're good at analyzing the data,

912
00:49:16,766 --> 00:49:18,820
even the first drawing can come out looking pretty.

913
00:49:18,844 --> 00:49:21,259
I think it's possible if we give you

914
00:49:21,653 --> 00:49:22,841
enough time.

915
00:49:22,865 --> 00:49:25,872
Are you bringing out the picture as you intended?

916
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:27,833
You need to keep that in mind.

917
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:30,199
As long as you're good at it, that's all.

918
00:49:30,444 --> 00:49:34,800
Whether it's my first drawing, the 100th, or the 1000th time,

919
00:49:34,892 --> 00:49:36,576
making a pretty picture...

920
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,875
I think the result will be similar.

921
00:49:40,032 --> 00:49:42,855
Of course, the time you spend in between

922
00:49:43,078 --> 00:49:46,195
and the naturalness of the touch that was applied,

923
00:49:46,219 --> 00:49:48,293
that's where your skills come out.

924
00:49:48,317 --> 00:49:50,425
The viewers will see your skills too.

925
00:49:50,539 --> 00:49:52,422
Of course, those things are important, too.

926
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:55,778
But you might think you must be bad at drawing

927
00:49:55,802 --> 00:49:57,343
because you haven't drawn for a long time.

928
00:49:57,367 --> 00:49:59,507
It's not for people who think like this.

929
00:49:59,605 --> 00:50:01,517
Even if you didn't draw a lot,

930
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:03,608
you can analyze the references clearly.

931
00:50:03,632 --> 00:50:05,702
If you can utilize that,

932
00:50:08,436 --> 00:50:10,436
you will be able to draw well quickly.

933
00:50:12,502 --> 00:50:14,190
I told you in the beginning...

934
00:50:14,215 --> 00:50:16,799
Illustration is, after all, is about conceptualizing and actually drawing.

935
00:50:17,592 --> 00:50:19,518
Since we're in the stages of conceptualizing and actually drawing,

936
00:50:19,542 --> 00:50:23,612
the process of thoroughly planning like we did before,

937
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:25,968
when you created a cute atmosphere,

938
00:50:25,992 --> 00:50:27,975
I told you how to do that.

939
00:50:28,104 --> 00:50:29,716
The process of directing those things...

940
00:50:29,741 --> 00:50:32,081
All of these things have a concept.

941
00:50:32,385 --> 00:50:35,311
The output is simply the process of pulling it out by hand.

942
00:50:35,436 --> 00:50:36,362
We can't help that.

943
00:50:36,373 --> 00:50:37,995
You can only get used to it by drawing a lot.

944
00:50:38,139 --> 00:50:39,994
But for the conceptual stage,

945
00:50:40,018 --> 00:50:41,387
in the conceptual and output phases,

946
00:50:41,412 --> 00:50:42,800
I said the idea was the most important thing.

947
00:50:42,862 --> 00:50:45,041
If you've mastered those stages,

948
00:50:45,066 --> 00:50:47,787
it's possible to draw.

949
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:49,296
Though it might not be easy to draw like how you want it to be.

950
00:50:49,401 --> 00:50:51,465
After that, you want to make the picture look pretty,

951
00:50:51,489 --> 00:50:52,726
and strengthen it.

952
00:50:53,958 --> 00:50:56,659
If you have studied humanities in college...

953
00:50:56,684 --> 00:50:58,567
I'm going to draw...

954
00:50:58,591 --> 00:51:00,922
If you're scared because you haven't done it a lot,

955
00:51:00,947 --> 00:51:04,021
Don't be too scared by the conceptual steps.

956
00:51:04,045 --> 00:51:05,318
You just have to make it more clear.

957
00:51:05,682 --> 00:51:07,767
What others will think about 3 times and move on.

958
00:51:07,791 --> 00:51:09,579
During that process, about 15 times.

959
00:51:09,603 --> 00:51:10,924
You just have to think about it before you go in.

960
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:13,244
It's a bit stupid, but

961
00:51:13,268 --> 00:51:15,677
sometimes stupid methods work best.

962
00:51:18,391 --> 00:51:19,713
If you don't like drawing,

963
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:21,779
what do you do when you draw the human body?

964
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,806
When you draw the human body, you look at yourself in a mirror and take pictures.

965
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:27,580
You might take a pose.

966
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:30,193
Isn't it a stupid way?

967
00:51:30,701 --> 00:51:33,251
But there's no other way to connect things as well as that.

968
00:51:33,276 --> 00:51:35,189
We actually use that method a lot

969
00:51:35,989 --> 00:51:37,146
Drawing is kind of...

970
00:51:37,173 --> 00:51:39,510
There are times when stupid methods are the best.

971
00:51:47,704 --> 00:51:49,723
Now that we're done with it,

972
00:51:49,748 --> 00:51:52,722
if the drawing is complete,

973
00:51:52,746 --> 00:51:55,000
we should edit it.

974
00:51:55,024 --> 00:51:57,717
Let's talk about this editing briefly.

975
00:52:10,824 --> 00:52:12,488
When I edit this later,

976
00:52:12,512 --> 00:52:13,926
how does it go in?

977
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:15,053
Let's take a look.

978
00:52:15,078 --> 00:52:17,614
There are effects that are used a lot in illustrations.

979
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:20,967
I usually use shiny textures

980
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:23,870
or Lens Flare.

981
00:52:25,248 --> 00:52:26,623
Let's use them.

982
00:52:26,758 --> 00:52:28,514
I usually use Google.

983
00:52:28,539 --> 00:52:31,385
If you search for glitter textures on Google,

984
00:52:31,409 --> 00:52:33,510
There are a lot of good materials that come up.

985
00:52:33,597 --> 00:52:36,878
Among them, I use a lot of pictures of the night sky.

986
00:52:36,902 --> 00:52:40,393
Let's say that I take these pictures of outer space.

987
00:52:40,987 --> 00:52:43,034
If I take all the pictures of outer space,

988
00:52:47,283 --> 00:52:50,585
I'll put this on top and apply the Screen effect.

989
00:52:51,095 --> 00:52:54,091
I'm going to apply only the bright parts of the Screen Layer.

990
00:52:54,116 --> 00:52:55,510
It's a concept that gives light.

991
00:52:56,324 --> 00:52:58,388
The light in the purple part of the background,

992
00:52:58,412 --> 00:52:59,432
comes in like this.

993
00:52:59,443 --> 00:53:01,889
But if you look at it like this, there's a square border.

994
00:53:01,914 --> 00:53:05,510
This dark part isn't the black that I used to have.

995
00:53:05,534 --> 00:53:08,590
People perceive it as a really bright color.

996
00:53:08,614 --> 00:53:09,683
That's what happens.

997
00:53:09,711 --> 00:53:15,797
If it bothers you, you can adjust the Levels

998
00:53:16,222 --> 00:53:18,992
to make a big difference between the bright and dark parts.

999
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:22,421
Especially, if you lower the dark part,

1000
00:53:22,537 --> 00:53:24,992
the edges on this side disappear quickly.

1001
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:27,492
Then only these glitters are left.

1002
00:53:27,992 --> 00:53:31,214
You can change the color of this character as you want,

1003
00:53:33,834 --> 00:53:35,073
and adjust the size,

1004
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:42,027
change the location,

1005
00:53:47,881 --> 00:53:50,996
and by changing the size using Ctrl+T,

1006
00:53:55,462 --> 00:53:58,320
you can adjust it until it feels like you want it.

1007
00:53:58,441 --> 00:54:00,508
I usually use this procedure,

1008
00:54:00,533 --> 00:54:02,304
and use a lot of glitter.

1009
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:06,312
It's pretty after you put it in.

1010
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,499
By changing the colors,

1011
00:54:35,091 --> 00:54:37,751
the glitter texture is literally

1012
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:40,216
point elements.

1013
00:54:40,241 --> 00:54:43,034
It's a very helpful element when you want to raise the quality of your drawing.

1014
00:54:46,534 --> 00:54:48,296
Of course, if you abuse it too much,

1015
00:54:48,715 --> 00:54:50,836
it kind of feels like pepper on the illustration.

1016
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:52,255
So it won't be good.

1017
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:54,124
It's important to use the right amount.

1018
00:55:08,861 --> 00:55:10,926
If you've added some glitters like this,

1019
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:13,523
after that, I'm going to use the Lens Flare.

1020
00:55:13,594 --> 00:55:15,866
The name of Lens Flare comes from

1021
00:55:15,891 --> 00:55:17,860
when we film the sunlight with our camera,

1022
00:55:17,884 --> 00:55:19,332
the light spreads through the lens,

1023
00:55:19,356 --> 00:55:20,998
and that's what they call a lens flare.

1024
00:55:21,022 --> 00:55:22,843
There are many types of lens flares.

1025
00:55:22,867 --> 00:55:25,909
Today, I'm going to use the horizontally long ones.

1026
00:55:27,132 --> 00:55:28,819
They're like this.

1027
00:55:30,913 --> 00:55:34,206
It's an expression that's commonly used in in-game illustrations.

1028
00:55:36,901 --> 00:55:38,284
I'll put this up like this.

1029
00:55:38,467 --> 00:55:39,991
The sunlight is coming in from the back,

1030
00:55:40,016 --> 00:55:41,917
so let's put it in this section.

1031
00:55:45,291 --> 00:55:46,690
It's too bright.

1032
00:55:48,092 --> 00:55:49,354
So I'll control the contrast.

1033
00:55:50,072 --> 00:55:51,248
Adjust the brightness.

1034
00:55:53,071 --> 00:55:55,612
And since the light from the back is yellow,

1035
00:55:55,637 --> 00:55:57,393
it'd be good if this one turns yellow, too.

1036
00:55:58,081 --> 00:55:59,511
Or maybe reddish.

1037
00:56:04,276 --> 00:56:05,878
According to the feeling you want,

1038
00:56:08,287 --> 00:56:09,698
by controlling the intensity,

1039
00:56:14,373 --> 00:56:16,710
you can use it while adjusting the angle.

1040
00:56:28,352 --> 00:56:30,161
Besides lens flares,

1041
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:33,798
it'd be good to use the round lens flares

1042
00:56:33,822 --> 00:56:35,015
and things like that, too.

1043
00:56:38,365 --> 00:56:40,907
Through the color adjustment,

1044
00:56:40,932 --> 00:56:43,009
you may change it to an orange color,

1045
00:56:48,517 --> 00:56:49,989
or using contrast adjustment,

1046
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:52,305
balance it out.

1047
00:57:00,786 --> 00:57:04,075
If you do this, you can create a pretty bright sunset.

1048
00:57:14,132 --> 00:57:16,384
Create another layer here.

1049
00:57:16,532 --> 00:57:19,118
The layer I'm going to use this time is an overlay layer.

1050
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:25,837
Using the orange light on the bottom left side of the light,

1051
00:57:25,862 --> 00:57:27,509
I'm going to give it a light that spreads out.

1052
00:57:27,536 --> 00:57:29,423
It's called scattering light.

1053
00:57:29,754 --> 00:57:32,486
If you adjust the scattering light like this,

1054
00:57:34,786 --> 00:57:37,294
you can make it feel like the light is spreading out more strongly.

1055
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:45,056
You can express reflective light,

1056
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:46,676
coming up from the bottom.

1057
00:57:53,656 --> 00:57:55,656
If it's edited like this,

1058
00:57:55,681 --> 00:57:57,255
When you see the before and after,

1059
00:57:58,683 --> 00:58:00,548
the illustration definitely would

1060
00:58:00,902 --> 00:58:02,696
become more flashy.

1061
00:58:02,891 --> 00:58:05,516
I'll tell you one thing that I use often.

1062
00:58:05,541 --> 00:58:06,843
For those who use Photoshop,

1063
00:58:06,867 --> 00:58:08,384
it's easier to follow.

1064
00:58:08,408 --> 00:58:09,946
After everything is done,

1065
00:58:09,973 --> 00:58:11,594
merge the layers that we can see.

1066
00:58:11,903 --> 00:58:13,098
And paste it on the top.

1067
00:58:13,786 --> 00:58:17,196
If you press the FX button on the bottom right,

1068
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:18,794
there's Blending Options.

1069
00:58:18,818 --> 00:58:21,016
If you go into this Blending Options tab,

1070
00:58:21,090 --> 00:58:24,020
a window pops up and there's RGB.

1071
00:58:24,048 --> 00:58:25,497
Please turn off one of them.

1072
00:58:25,521 --> 00:58:28,074
You can turn it off depending on the color of the illustration.

1073
00:58:28,179 --> 00:58:31,899
After you turn it off, if you turn it around,

1074
00:58:32,625 --> 00:58:35,281
it's like the color is breaking.

1075
00:58:35,562 --> 00:58:38,587
I call this a digital effect.

1076
00:58:40,813 --> 00:58:43,448
The color changes depending on which RGB you turn off.

1077
00:58:44,537 --> 00:58:47,403
So you can adjust the result to the one you like.

1078
00:58:54,521 --> 00:58:56,247
Because of the color breaking,

1079
00:58:56,272 --> 00:58:58,709
there's a bit of a density in the illustration.

1080
00:58:58,752 --> 00:59:00,986
As density is added,

1081
00:59:01,010 --> 00:59:03,010
the particles in the illustration get smaller.

1082
00:59:03,146 --> 00:59:07,108
The smaller the particles, the higher the quality of the illustration.

1083
00:59:07,259 --> 00:59:09,583
So, you can make the particles smaller

1084
00:59:09,616 --> 00:59:11,385
so that the quality of the illustration can be enhanced.

1085
00:59:11,409 --> 00:59:13,186
It's one of the elements that allow you to do that.

1086
00:59:13,384 --> 00:59:14,796
To put it simply,

1087
00:59:14,821 --> 00:59:17,464
if you do this, it looks like there's a lot of color in it.

1088
00:59:17,489 --> 00:59:19,593
It looks like there are various colors in it.

1089
00:59:19,683 --> 00:59:21,671
So the quality of the drawing

1090
00:59:21,695 --> 00:59:22,683
looks higher.

1091
00:59:22,905 --> 00:59:25,964
Noise effects are used a lot, similarly.

1092
00:59:25,992 --> 00:59:29,385
Here's [Filter] [Noise].

1093
00:59:29,410 --> 00:59:32,113
There are [add noise/ decrease noise], things like this.

1094
00:59:32,503 --> 00:59:34,098
For example, if you add noise,

1095
00:59:34,335 --> 00:59:36,363
and if you don't zoom in, you won't be able to see it.

1096
00:59:36,388 --> 00:59:38,388
If you zoom in here,

1097
00:59:39,027 --> 00:59:40,684
the illustration breaks like this.

1098
00:59:41,234 --> 00:59:44,106
What's good about these cracks?

1099
00:59:44,405 --> 00:59:47,523
Since casual characters are simple to describe,

1100
00:59:47,548 --> 00:59:49,160
the particles are

1101
00:59:49,184 --> 00:59:50,578
kind of big.

1102
00:59:50,602 --> 00:59:54,036
So, as it went in, it felt like the particles got smaller.

1103
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:55,069
Thus, the quality of the illustration

1104
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:56,926
looks better.

1105
00:59:56,951 --> 00:59:59,957
In the past, when I was drawing,

1106
00:59:59,981 --> 01:00:02,582
I drew in a big size and reduced the size.

1107
01:00:02,606 --> 01:00:04,903
I often did it to break the illustration on purpose.

1108
01:00:05,141 --> 01:00:06,488
That's similar to this.

1109
01:00:06,512 --> 01:00:09,562
If you break the illustration, it'll break into pixels.

1110
01:00:09,587 --> 01:00:11,254
So the character looks

1111
01:00:11,278 --> 01:00:12,684
a bit more high-quality.

1112
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:15,517
So, using these parts,

1113
01:00:16,418 --> 01:00:19,411
if you edit the picture, the picture becomes very fancy.

1114
01:00:19,436 --> 01:00:20,726
Before and after.

1115
01:00:22,156 --> 01:00:26,691
What we did today is how to make it more descriptive.

1116
01:00:27,297 --> 01:00:29,256
And when we were doing the description,

1117
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,406
we went through the things

1118
01:00:31,431 --> 01:00:33,406
that we have to consider.

1119
01:00:33,509 --> 01:00:36,625
You have to think about density distribution when you're doing the description.

1120
01:00:37,058 --> 01:00:38,598
And the contrast,

1121
01:00:38,622 --> 01:00:40,683
depending on the lighting, you need to think about the contrast,

1122
01:00:40,708 --> 01:00:42,531
and the density distribution,

1123
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:45,598
changing the color,

1124
01:00:45,731 --> 01:00:47,199
you have to consider a lot of things.

1125
01:00:47,649 --> 01:00:50,808
Other than that, there are highlights,

1126
01:00:51,171 --> 01:00:54,905
and how to describe with materials.

1127
01:00:55,361 --> 01:00:57,710
And after that, through the editing process,

1128
01:00:57,735 --> 01:00:59,770
you can improve the quality of the drawing.

1129
01:01:00,153 --> 01:01:03,113
Then you'll be able to finish up your illustration.

1130
01:01:05,381 --> 01:01:08,609
If you look at the before and after,

1131
01:01:08,902 --> 01:01:10,734
this one is before,

1132
01:01:11,773 --> 01:01:15,125
and this is what we edited today.

1133
01:01:15,570 --> 01:01:19,152
By checking these details,

1134
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:21,624
I hope we can finish it well.

1135
01:01:21,709 --> 01:01:23,726
I'll finish this drawing later,

1136
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:25,576
I'll make a note of it somewhere.

1137
01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:27,771
That's all for today.

1138
01:01:27,773 --> 01:01:29,226
Thank you for your attention.
