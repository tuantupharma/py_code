00:00:06,078 --> 00:00:07,093
Hello.

3
00:00:07,563 --> 00:00:10,877
Today, we are going to learn about the face.

4
00:00:11,882 --> 00:00:13,171
The character's face.

5
00:00:13,173 --> 00:00:15,045
But some may start drawing the facial part

6
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:19,437
before they work on the body.

7
00:00:19,554 --> 00:00:22,285
Most people start drawing

8
00:00:22,287 --> 00:00:26,027
because they want to draw a beautiful character.

9
00:00:26,281 --> 00:00:30,228
The reason I put the facial part after the body is simply that it's important.

10
00:00:30,915 --> 00:00:32,850
It's really important.

11
00:00:33,132 --> 00:00:34,537
Even some people say that

12
00:00:34,562 --> 00:00:36,588
you can get a job

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,289
if you can just draw the face successfully.

14
00:00:38,398 --> 00:00:41,203
But you should be able to draw the other parts as well.

15
00:00:41,228 --> 00:00:42,956
Especially the body.

16
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:46,210
But that shows how important the face is.

17
00:00:46,343 --> 00:00:47,857
Some people can draw the body well

18
00:00:47,882 --> 00:00:50,115
while they express the facial part in poorly.

19
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,164
This is true in realistic drawing.

20
00:00:54,265 --> 00:00:57,013
And of course, in casual drawing as well.

21
00:00:57,015 --> 00:01:00,000
So the face is really important.

22
00:01:00,002 --> 00:01:00,777
Therefore,

23
00:01:00,801 --> 00:01:02,289
since

24
00:01:02,382 --> 00:01:04,685
this part is important,

25
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,750
it's difficult at the same time.

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,260
In our brain,

27
00:01:08,272 --> 00:01:11,132
there's a separate part where you can recognize a person's expressions.

28
00:01:11,859 --> 00:01:13,373
That means the human brain

29
00:01:13,398 --> 00:01:14,310
can catch the expressions

30
00:01:14,335 --> 00:01:17,693
in detail.

31
00:01:17,718 --> 00:01:18,814
Because of that,

32
00:01:18,826 --> 00:01:21,732
you may know if you have some experience in facial drawing.

33
00:01:21,757 --> 00:01:23,209
If I get just one pixel wrong,

34
00:01:23,234 --> 00:01:24,853
it becomes weird.

35
00:01:24,854 --> 00:01:27,671
So you can catch tiny glitches at one glance.

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,771
Also, the face

37
00:01:29,796 --> 00:01:31,826
has a lot of details

38
00:01:31,851 --> 00:01:34,617
like bumpy bones,

39
00:01:34,726 --> 00:01:36,221
and several muscles.

40
00:01:36,233 --> 00:01:38,546
More than any other part of the human body.

41
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:41,107
So the more you dig into the details,

42
00:01:41,132 --> 00:01:42,718
the more you have to study.

43
00:01:42,743 --> 00:01:45,438
So let's have a look into these parts as well.

44
00:01:45,609 --> 00:01:48,781
When you work on this part,

45
00:01:51,343 --> 00:01:52,492
there are

46
00:01:55,384 --> 00:01:56,648
two important things

47
00:01:57,078 --> 00:01:59,265
you have to set first.

48
00:01:59,929 --> 00:02:02,750
So you need sophisticated expressions

49
00:02:02,931 --> 00:02:04,718
when you work on the face.

50
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,101
Then you can say your drawing is stabilized.

51
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,593
And secondly,

52
00:02:15,663 --> 00:02:17,343
you have to make it look good.

53
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,935
Since this is commercial art, it's a necessary skill.

54
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,318
But when the character isn't good-looking,

55
00:02:26,343 --> 00:02:28,078
and you want to do some artistic works,

56
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:30,475
then

57
00:02:30,487 --> 00:02:32,256
it may not be essential.

58
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:33,943
But if you are into the casual style

59
00:02:33,968 --> 00:02:36,960
which is more commercial art,

60
00:02:36,962 --> 00:02:39,818
it will be essential.

61
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:43,576
Of course, this could be your standard of beauty,

62
00:02:43,601 --> 00:02:46,140
but it could be a popular aesthetic standard.

63
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:51,264
We will go through both of these today.

64
00:02:51,266 --> 00:02:53,178
How to draw the face accurately.

65
00:02:53,203 --> 00:02:55,959
And several tips to make it look good.

66
00:02:55,984 --> 00:02:57,459
But before we move on,

67
00:02:57,484 --> 00:02:59,388
I'll tell you something that's even more important

68
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:01,906
to do with accuracy.

69
00:03:03,492 --> 00:03:05,656
The first thing we're going to see is a head shape.

70
00:03:08,093 --> 00:03:10,095
In the previous lecture,

71
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,514
we talked about the ratio,

72
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:13,850
and the ratio of the human face is 2:1.

73
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,264
In the case of a casual character,

74
00:03:15,289 --> 00:03:16,482
it's a bit different.

75
00:03:16,507 --> 00:03:18,867
So it'll be up to 1.8.

76
00:03:19,484 --> 00:03:22,323
If we have a face with that proportion,

77
00:03:22,325 --> 00:03:24,843
it will only look like that when we look at it up front.

78
00:03:24,868 --> 00:03:26,664
Today, I'll turn this around.

79
00:03:28,414 --> 00:03:29,498
But before we go on,

80
00:03:29,523 --> 00:03:30,771
I want to tell you something

81
00:03:30,796 --> 00:03:33,132
about the cuboid shape.

82
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,920
By now, you would have noticed that

83
00:03:35,945 --> 00:03:38,000
when drawing the human body,

84
00:03:38,025 --> 00:03:39,539
you would draw cuboids a lot.

85
00:03:39,765 --> 00:03:41,357
Especially, when you're drawing the head,

86
00:03:41,382 --> 00:03:43,250
you would draw this shape a lot.

87
00:03:44,371 --> 00:03:47,281
It's as if a smaller cuboid was cut off from a larger cuboid.

88
00:03:47,851 --> 00:03:51,381
So, you need to be good at drawing cuboids.

89
00:03:51,406 --> 00:03:53,351
The important thing with cuboids

90
00:03:53,546 --> 00:03:54,671
is that

91
00:03:54,696 --> 00:03:57,390
you need to be able to apply perspective.

92
00:03:57,828 --> 00:03:59,671
Note that the upper side and the underside

93
00:03:59,696 --> 00:04:01,483
don't have the same perspective applied.

94
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:04,976
If a high-angle is applied here, it would be applied more here.

95
00:04:05,023 --> 00:04:07,015
Remember that.

96
00:04:07,717 --> 00:04:10,492
So, let's say we're looking at it from here.

97
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,351
If this is the eye level,

98
00:04:16,075 --> 00:04:19,203
if it goes up, a low-angle would be applied a bit.

99
00:04:19,585 --> 00:04:21,578
And as it goes upwards, it would be applied more.

100
00:04:22,445 --> 00:04:25,585
It would just look flat from here.

101
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,421
Go downwards, and a high-angle would be applied a bit.

102
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,787
Go downwards a bit more, and it would be applied more.

103
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:31,193
So, you should be able to

104
00:04:31,218 --> 00:04:34,367
apply different amounts of perspective to a character's face.

105
00:04:34,593 --> 00:04:37,828
You need to be able to draw how the dimensions would change.

106
00:04:38,257 --> 00:04:40,756
That's why you should practice

107
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,429
drawing cuboids as much as you can.

108
00:04:42,901 --> 00:04:45,740
I'll recommend that you do this

109
00:04:45,765 --> 00:04:46,757
when you're drawing the head.

110
00:04:46,898 --> 00:04:48,944
Now, let's go back.

111
00:04:51,476 --> 00:04:54,162
Overall, the head looks like

112
00:04:54,187 --> 00:04:56,023
a cuboid.

113
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,584
A head is basically a cuboid

114
00:04:58,609 --> 00:05:01,429
with a chin attached to it.

115
00:05:01,454 --> 00:05:02,784
Think of it like that.

116
00:05:02,786 --> 00:05:04,312
If we look at it from the side,

117
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,546
the overall shape would look like this.

118
00:05:09,367 --> 00:05:11,421
Like what I drew,

119
00:05:20,301 --> 00:05:21,750
the chin sticks

120
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,453
to the counterpoint.

121
00:05:27,015 --> 00:05:28,467
But, the proportion changes a bit

122
00:05:28,492 --> 00:05:30,561
with casual-style characters.

123
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:31,865
In the case of casual style,

124
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,978
the head becomes bigger compared to a realistic drawing style.

125
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,460
So, in this process,

126
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:42,781
draw as if the forehead and the back of the head

127
00:05:42,806 --> 00:05:44,203
are pulled backward.

128
00:05:44,726 --> 00:05:46,982
It looks like an alien for now.

129
00:05:47,007 --> 00:05:48,757
The back of their head is really big.

130
00:05:49,734 --> 00:05:51,132
Just like an alien.

131
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,075
It's good to make a shape

132
00:05:53,077 --> 00:05:54,742
where the back of their head is

133
00:05:54,906 --> 00:05:56,706
a bit big and the top is high.

134
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,765
As a result,

135
00:06:01,031 --> 00:06:02,321
the shape that comes out like this

136
00:06:02,447 --> 00:06:05,234
is divided into half of the lower part

137
00:06:06,312 --> 00:06:07,992
and half of this part,

138
00:06:08,265 --> 00:06:13,386
you can think of it as a split.

139
00:06:13,593 --> 00:06:15,068
Some people draw it like this

140
00:06:15,093 --> 00:06:17,687
when they put on facial expressions.

141
00:06:18,546 --> 00:06:20,404
Some people draw it like this,

142
00:06:20,429 --> 00:06:21,664
to set the basic shape of the face.

143
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:24,406
I don't recommend it.

144
00:06:24,671 --> 00:06:26,131
Some people say

145
00:06:26,156 --> 00:06:28,037
when you draw a picture for the first time,

146
00:06:28,062 --> 00:06:29,617
draw a cross line first.

147
00:06:29,718 --> 00:06:32,209
The people who are learning take it

148
00:06:32,234 --> 00:06:34,381
as it is and start by drawing a cross line.

149
00:06:34,406 --> 00:06:35,829
Not many people use it properly

150
00:06:35,841 --> 00:06:37,519
after drawing a cross line.

151
00:06:38,132 --> 00:06:39,420
Even after they drew this,

152
00:06:39,445 --> 00:06:42,937
they draw the eyes at a completely different spot.

153
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:46,179
Or, when they draw the nose, they might not draw on this line.

154
00:06:46,328 --> 00:06:49,451
In fact, it is impossible to draw a cross line

155
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:50,648
on the face.

156
00:06:51,437 --> 00:06:52,389
Why is that?

157
00:06:52,414 --> 00:06:55,002
The curves on our faces aren't that simple.

158
00:06:55,004 --> 00:06:57,086
No one has a flat face like that.

159
00:06:57,304 --> 00:07:00,039
When we look at our head, the forehead goes slightly upwards

160
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,742
if we're looking at it sideways.

161
00:07:02,953 --> 00:07:04,953
The eyebrow bones bulge out a bit.

162
00:07:05,163 --> 00:07:06,781
And the eye sockets go in.

163
00:07:07,088 --> 00:07:08,476
The nose bridge goes in

164
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:09,828
and then the nose pops out.

165
00:07:11,495 --> 00:07:14,648
The underside of the nose goes in, pops out, then goes in.

166
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:18,929
Then, the philtrum and the lips pop out.

167
00:07:20,343 --> 00:07:23,911
The chin goes in, but the bottom of it pops out.

168
00:07:23,936 --> 00:07:27,074
You can see that it is very detailed.

169
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:29,876
That's why when you finish it off as one line,

170
00:07:29,878 --> 00:07:31,330
you'll get a lot of details wrong.

171
00:07:31,427 --> 00:07:34,315
So, I don't recommend drawing a cross line.

172
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:35,841
So, how would you draw guidelines?

173
00:07:36,044 --> 00:07:38,099
Remember how we divided the head into cuboids?

174
00:07:39,232 --> 00:07:40,950
Draw the guidelines on them.

175
00:07:41,971 --> 00:07:44,614
Draw the center lines on the cuboid

176
00:07:45,378 --> 00:07:47,271
that's on the top.

177
00:07:48,575 --> 00:07:51,267
Then, you might wonder if it's okay

178
00:07:51,292 --> 00:07:54,480
because this one's more simplified than

179
00:07:54,482 --> 00:07:55,858
the one we drew previously.

180
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,792
The line we're drawing is a guideline, no matter what.

181
00:07:59,596 --> 00:08:02,706
You're drawing this line to check if

182
00:08:03,198 --> 00:08:05,188
what you're drawing is in the center.

183
00:08:05,213 --> 00:08:09,520
First, we'd draw straight lines.

184
00:08:09,885 --> 00:08:11,779
Although we can't get detailed information from it,

185
00:08:11,803 --> 00:08:13,360
it won't be the wrong information.

186
00:08:13,385 --> 00:08:15,381
So, first, draw a line

187
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:16,485
that goes through the center.

188
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,838
That's the first step.

189
00:08:18,048 --> 00:08:19,681
The second one will come out later.

190
00:08:21,236 --> 00:08:24,697
Let's take a look at the proportions

191
00:08:24,775 --> 00:08:26,150
of the face.

192
00:08:27,896 --> 00:08:30,750
So basically this line in the middle is

193
00:08:30,775 --> 00:08:32,119
eye-level.

194
00:08:33,322 --> 00:08:35,814
This is where you are going to draw the eyes.

195
00:08:36,212 --> 00:08:38,447
The size of the eyes will be different for each person.

196
00:08:38,548 --> 00:08:40,622
I'm going to draw them bigger today.

197
00:08:40,624 --> 00:08:41,900
So that it is discernible.

198
00:08:43,447 --> 00:08:44,923
The eyes are here at this level.

199
00:08:45,009 --> 00:08:48,446
If the eyes go in like this,

200
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:50,400
there are ear grooves at the same height as this.

201
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:52,486
We usually wear glasses.

202
00:08:54,072 --> 00:08:55,701
So the character has to be able to wear glasses.

203
00:08:55,725 --> 00:08:57,297
Anyway, if you wear glasses,

204
00:08:57,322 --> 00:09:00,172
the height of these glasses has to match the eye level.

205
00:09:01,884 --> 00:09:04,220
It is easy to see that the height of the ear is

206
00:09:04,245 --> 00:09:07,158
the same as the height of the eye.

207
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:09,486
Let's say the ears are here.

208
00:09:09,488 --> 00:09:11,861
Then it'll be very uncomfortable when you wear glasses.

209
00:09:12,611 --> 00:09:13,738
They slid down.

210
00:09:13,978 --> 00:09:16,791
Or if it goes up, it'll be uncomfortable as well.

211
00:09:16,939 --> 00:09:19,919
Therefore, it is important to draw this groove the same

212
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,627
as the height of the eye.

213
00:09:21,652 --> 00:09:24,798
This becomes the center of the side of the head.

214
00:09:25,794 --> 00:09:27,088
In the center of the side head,

215
00:09:28,783 --> 00:09:32,736
of course, to be exact, it's slightly in the front rather than the center.

216
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:35,533
Because we extended the back of the head at the early stage.

217
00:09:35,736 --> 00:09:37,486
So we don't need to include it.

218
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:39,968
It's slightly towards the front rather than the center.

219
00:09:39,969 --> 00:09:43,025
But let's memorize it as the center of the side of the head.

220
00:09:44,633 --> 00:09:46,338
I'm going to draw the other eye.

221
00:09:52,595 --> 00:09:55,836
Let's talk about the details of the eyes later.

222
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,720
So let's go for the proportion part first.

223
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:01,703
Now, we need to know where the nose and mouth are.

224
00:10:01,728 --> 00:10:04,563
We drew this square

225
00:10:04,588 --> 00:10:06,218
and put the chin on the bottom.

226
00:10:06,377 --> 00:10:09,259
Supposed it's the chin,

227
00:10:11,264 --> 00:10:14,650
you can think of the height of the mouth as the center.

228
00:10:16,236 --> 00:10:19,111
So, I'll draw the nose here.

229
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,494
The mouth should go around here.

230
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,994
It will be a bit above the center.

231
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:32,189
We can say that the teeth

232
00:10:34,306 --> 00:10:35,298
go in

233
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:39,814
like this, in this area.

234
00:10:43,593 --> 00:10:47,213
So, that's how we would set the proportions for the face.

235
00:10:48,619 --> 00:10:51,080
And if you can do that,

236
00:10:54,805 --> 00:10:56,413
you'll have a bald person like this.

237
00:10:57,197 --> 00:10:59,685
So, let's review how the neck would stick to the head.

238
00:10:59,687 --> 00:11:02,851
Draw the sternocleidomastoid muscle, then stick the neck to the back of the head.

239
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:08,077
Its thickness will be the same length as the area between the canthi if it's a male character.

240
00:11:08,484 --> 00:11:10,691
Although it is not exact,

241
00:11:10,693 --> 00:11:12,812
I think this could be the final shape.

242
00:11:17,671 --> 00:11:20,234
This is the approximate proportion of the face.

243
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:22,794
Let's go into more detail now.

244
00:11:22,819 --> 00:11:26,116
The first thing to go into detail about is the eyes.

245
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,866
When we draw the casual face of a character,

246
00:11:29,944 --> 00:11:31,218
the most important part

247
00:11:31,243 --> 00:11:33,710
which requires a lot of effort at the same time

248
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:35,976
would be the eyes.

249
00:11:36,382 --> 00:11:40,202
If you are going to draw the eyes, you need to know the structure of the eyes.

250
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:42,732
You need to be able to know the detailed structure

251
00:11:42,757 --> 00:11:45,398
near the area where the eyes go in.

252
00:11:47,468 --> 00:11:48,452
It may sound difficult.

253
00:11:48,477 --> 00:11:49,335
But let's try it.

254
00:11:50,726 --> 00:11:54,265
When we look at our eyes in profile,

255
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,085
there's the eye socket,

256
00:11:58,726 --> 00:12:02,304
where our eyeballs would go in.

257
00:12:02,491 --> 00:12:06,898
From there, our eyes would bulge out.

258
00:12:07,562 --> 00:12:12,288
And, our eyelids cover that

259
00:12:12,577 --> 00:12:14,100
like this.

260
00:12:15,507 --> 00:12:17,833
These would form the overall eye.

261
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,536
So, that's the basic shape of the eye.

262
00:12:20,911 --> 00:12:24,153
So, what would be important from here?

263
00:12:24,178 --> 00:12:28,216
First of all, the eye itself is a hole.

264
00:12:28,411 --> 00:12:30,055
It goes inwards.

265
00:12:30,223 --> 00:12:32,762
Why is this important?

266
00:12:32,787 --> 00:12:34,054
It becomes important

267
00:12:34,066 --> 00:12:37,067
when the character's head looks in a certain direction.

268
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:39,333
I didn't apply that here.

269
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:40,797
But, let's see what happens

270
00:12:40,809 --> 00:12:42,114
if we actually did apply that.

271
00:12:43,286 --> 00:12:44,184
This is how it would look.

272
00:12:45,006 --> 00:12:47,325
You might ask what's different.

273
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:51,786
We call this bone here

274
00:12:51,911 --> 00:12:54,651
the eyelid bone.

275
00:12:54,676 --> 00:12:57,419
The eyebrows would be drawn on top of here.

276
00:12:57,684 --> 00:12:59,930
In fact, if you touch your eyebrows,

277
00:12:59,955 --> 00:13:02,817
you can check that it's solid underneath.

278
00:13:03,684 --> 00:13:07,339
This is because the bones around the eyes bulge out.

279
00:13:07,364 --> 00:13:09,520
See how the character's looking to the left?

280
00:13:09,842 --> 00:13:11,520
So, this eyebrow bone

281
00:13:12,296 --> 00:13:15,059
would bulge out to the left

282
00:13:16,411 --> 00:13:18,192
compared to the eye, which goes inwards.

283
00:13:18,512 --> 00:13:21,028
So, what would happen if the character was looking to the right?

284
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:23,211
If it does so,

285
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:25,403
the eyebrow bone would bulge out to the right.

286
00:13:29,598 --> 00:13:32,528
And the eye would bulge out from the inside.

287
00:13:32,885 --> 00:13:34,333
And under here,

288
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,161
there would be the cheekbone.

289
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:40,749
Make sure the cheekbones pop out a bit.

290
00:13:40,751 --> 00:13:43,215
Then, you'll have the overall shape of the eyes.

291
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:47,348
So if you look into the whole shape of the face,

292
00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:52,299
you can see that this is what it looks like this.

293
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,328
Like this,

294
00:13:59,062 --> 00:14:02,250
depending on the knowledge of the structure,

295
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:03,968
the accuracy of the face varies.

296
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:07,406
So please remember it.

297
00:14:07,407 --> 00:14:09,121
I emphasize this part every time,

298
00:14:09,145 --> 00:14:10,520
but people often make mistakes.

299
00:14:10,664 --> 00:14:12,184
This part is really difficult.

300
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:13,170
Therefore,

301
00:14:13,195 --> 00:14:14,556
if you don't get this part,

302
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,730
then lookup for some photos, and copy drawing.

303
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:18,195
Especially the face of the elderly,

304
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,818
or middle-aged men.

305
00:14:20,843 --> 00:14:24,351
Or marble statues, etc.

306
00:14:24,353 --> 00:14:26,896
So try to practice

307
00:14:27,246 --> 00:14:28,966
and analyze this part.

308
00:14:28,991 --> 00:14:30,572
People often make mistakes in this part.

309
00:14:30,596 --> 00:14:31,911
That's why I keep emphasizing it.

310
00:14:33,489 --> 00:14:34,261
Then,

311
00:14:34,286 --> 00:14:36,802
now you know the overall structure of the eyes, you should know about the eyes.

312
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:38,269
The eyes.

313
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,685
Everyone applies deformers differently.

314
00:14:40,872 --> 00:14:43,980
So, I'll tell you which parts

315
00:14:43,982 --> 00:14:46,089
you could focus on

316
00:14:46,114 --> 00:14:49,450
when you're creating your own style.

317
00:14:50,107 --> 00:14:52,000
So let's look into the basic structure of the eyes.

318
00:14:52,002 --> 00:14:53,622
So here's the upper eyelid.

319
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:57,318
Let's go into detail.

320
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:01,457
Let's divide the upper eyelid

321
00:15:02,418 --> 00:15:03,818
into three lines.

322
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,519
There's the eye wall

323
00:15:08,544 --> 00:15:09,920
right under this inner eyebrow.

324
00:15:10,185 --> 00:15:11,488
It's basically skin.

325
00:15:11,513 --> 00:15:13,497
If this is the eyebrow,

326
00:15:14,004 --> 00:15:15,997
there's the eye wall underneath it.

327
00:15:16,595 --> 00:15:18,450
I'm going over this area because

328
00:15:18,475 --> 00:15:19,783
some of you

329
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,622
may draw the eye like this.

330
00:15:22,763 --> 00:15:23,431
Like this,

331
00:15:24,193 --> 00:15:26,505
some people express the inside in two lines

332
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:29,132
and this one would be the eyeball.

333
00:15:30,005 --> 00:15:32,630
Depending on the person, some people draw it like this.

334
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,513
Usually, depending on the characters,

335
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:39,521
they have four lines.

336
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,911
And the fifth line,

337
00:15:43,403 --> 00:15:45,058
right next to the eye.

338
00:15:45,082 --> 00:15:46,679
Underneath the eye,

339
00:15:46,692 --> 00:15:49,528
you may draw it in different ways.

340
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:52,114
I'll draw two this time.

341
00:15:54,109 --> 00:15:56,308
So there are about seven lines

342
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:58,153
in the overall appearance of the eye.

343
00:15:58,298 --> 00:16:00,399
If you draw additional things here,

344
00:16:00,411 --> 00:16:01,599
you could draw this.

345
00:16:01,989 --> 00:16:05,155
This is the red triangular area in front of the eyes.

346
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,671
There are people who draw this area.

347
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,802
I'll set this to number 8 just in case.

348
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:14,074
Now, double eyelids could be formed here.

349
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:15,294
So, what is it?

350
00:16:16,235 --> 00:16:19,286
When there's too much skin above the eye,

351
00:16:20,964 --> 00:16:24,333
it will be folded because there isn't enough space.

352
00:16:24,935 --> 00:16:28,552
After it's folded, our eyes would pop out.

353
00:16:28,732 --> 00:16:31,114
This would be the double eyelid.

354
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:33,876
Some people have thick double eyelids, while others have thin double eyelids.

355
00:16:33,901 --> 00:16:36,295
Some people only have it on one eye.

356
00:16:36,357 --> 00:16:39,224
I usually draw double eyelids for my characters.

357
00:16:39,943 --> 00:16:41,863
I will go through this part later

358
00:16:41,888 --> 00:16:44,002
but around the eyes,

359
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,652
people often draw double eyelids a lot

360
00:16:46,677 --> 00:16:48,497
to make it look good.

361
00:16:50,268 --> 00:16:53,802
Then these double eyelids will be the ninth line.

362
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,636
So the eyebrows come out from here.

363
00:16:57,661 --> 00:17:01,247
Some people draw another line like this before the eyebrows.

364
00:17:01,744 --> 00:17:02,964
Sometimes people draw a line like this.

365
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:05,597
So you may wonder if this is the triple eyelid.

366
00:17:05,622 --> 00:17:08,941
To be exact, think of it as the seat under the eyes

367
00:17:08,966 --> 00:17:13,075
rather than the double eyelids.

368
00:17:13,778 --> 00:17:14,861
That means,

369
00:17:14,886 --> 00:17:16,690
if the character opens their eyes

370
00:17:16,715 --> 00:17:18,890
it would reach up to this line

371
00:17:18,892 --> 00:17:20,528
so this line would be the limit line.

372
00:17:22,002 --> 00:17:23,519
These lines are guidelines

373
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:25,006
to let you know the boundaries

374
00:17:25,031 --> 00:17:26,759
such as the eyeball

375
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,555
and the bone.

376
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,767
Some people applied this without knowing the reason

377
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:32,761
what those are for.

378
00:17:32,786 --> 00:17:34,876
Many people who practiced drawing

379
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,152
while copying casual style characters

380
00:17:37,177 --> 00:17:39,308
draw a line right here.

381
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:41,521
But, they can't answer why they drew this line.

382
00:17:41,747 --> 00:17:42,949
So,

383
00:17:42,974 --> 00:17:45,660
let's find out what this line is for.

384
00:17:45,685 --> 00:17:48,771
Although these days, a lot of people don't draw this line.

385
00:17:48,896 --> 00:17:52,208
It's a line that is used a lot in the old casual drawing style.

386
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:54,005
So here's the tenth line.

387
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:59,964
Let's say this is the upper part of the eye, then we should look at the lower part.

388
00:17:59,989 --> 00:18:01,586
In the lower part of the eyes,

389
00:18:01,588 --> 00:18:03,402
on the outer right here,

390
00:18:03,427 --> 00:18:05,730
some people draw another line like this.

391
00:18:05,755 --> 00:18:08,626
So you may wonder what it is.

392
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:09,607
This line would be the part

393
00:18:09,872 --> 00:18:12,763
where when you're looking at the eye from the side,

394
00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:14,460
this skin area

395
00:18:16,002 --> 00:18:18,216
that is right below the eye.

396
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,725
That skin part stays the same

397
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,724
and the eyelashes stick to this part.

398
00:18:26,341 --> 00:18:27,533
If they stick more inwards,

399
00:18:27,557 --> 00:18:29,443
your eyes would hurt.

400
00:18:29,763 --> 00:18:32,935
The eyebrows are attached to the outside of this area.

401
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,200
So, this line describes

402
00:18:35,225 --> 00:18:37,647
the part where the eyebrows would be attached.

403
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:40,177
So, there are people that draw like this.

404
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,299
Most people who draw like this

405
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:46,211
are describing this area.

406
00:18:46,213 --> 00:18:48,318
The area where the skin is folded.

407
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:51,193
And, furthermore,

408
00:18:52,614 --> 00:18:55,984
there are people who draw additional curves underneath.

409
00:18:55,985 --> 00:18:57,217
However,

410
00:18:57,778 --> 00:18:59,067
this won't be too necessary.

411
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:04,050
So, these are the curves we can see around the eye area.

412
00:19:07,091 --> 00:19:09,464
So, what next?

413
00:19:09,489 --> 00:19:11,313
Now, you should find your drawing style.

414
00:19:11,528 --> 00:19:12,699
Let me give you an example.

415
00:19:12,724 --> 00:19:14,839
For example, if you want to draw a character with a sharp impression,

416
00:19:14,864 --> 00:19:17,620
you can omit numbers 2 and 3.

417
00:19:17,622 --> 00:19:18,771
But how?

418
00:19:19,146 --> 00:19:21,880
One, two, and three.

419
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:25,419
And then direct to five.

420
00:19:26,409 --> 00:19:27,872
And skip seven, six,

421
00:19:32,302 --> 00:19:33,622
eight as well.

422
00:19:35,787 --> 00:19:36,833
Like this,

423
00:19:37,771 --> 00:19:38,902
draw double eyelids.

424
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:40,049
If you don't want to draw the double eyelids,

425
00:19:44,818 --> 00:19:46,856
draw a space here,

426
00:19:47,633 --> 00:19:49,060
and attach the eyebrows.

427
00:19:51,224 --> 00:19:53,778
Make sure they go outwards like this.

428
00:19:54,224 --> 00:19:56,935
This is how you would apply deformers.

429
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,411
If you express everything,

430
00:19:58,436 --> 00:20:00,560
the character would look very gentle.

431
00:20:00,747 --> 00:20:02,441
So expressing all of these,

432
00:20:02,466 --> 00:20:04,677
you can give it a mature look.

433
00:20:05,068 --> 00:20:06,790
One, two, three.

434
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,466
By giving it subtle changes in angle,

435
00:20:08,864 --> 00:20:11,774
when you omit these, the character would be extremely stylized.

436
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:14,707
This eye would be used often for 'chibi' characters.

437
00:20:14,732 --> 00:20:18,122
On the other hand, the eye at the bottom

438
00:20:18,147 --> 00:20:19,519
has a more realistic style.

439
00:20:19,544 --> 00:20:22,427
So you can adjust the degree of deformers

440
00:20:22,452 --> 00:20:24,888
depending on

441
00:20:24,913 --> 00:20:26,794
whether you use more or less line information.

442
00:20:27,489 --> 00:20:30,427
And depending on how you change the line,

443
00:20:30,927 --> 00:20:34,505
the shape of the eyeball and the character's impression will change.

444
00:20:34,646 --> 00:20:37,732
So it's good to learn some patterns.

445
00:20:38,302 --> 00:20:40,540
Let's check out the patterns that people often use.

446
00:20:47,573 --> 00:20:51,458
The first case is the one with a sharp impression.

447
00:20:52,078 --> 00:20:55,419
It's a case where it looks half-open.

448
00:20:57,466 --> 00:21:01,113
In this case, the double eyelid spreads out slightly.

449
00:21:01,138 --> 00:21:02,299
Why does it spread out?

450
00:21:02,324 --> 00:21:03,941
Remember when I said

451
00:21:03,966 --> 00:21:06,972
this area is formed when the eyes are open, and there is little space.

452
00:21:06,997 --> 00:21:08,925
But, if we only open our eyes halfway, there's space left,

453
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:11,372
so the double eyelids are formed naturally.

454
00:21:12,487 --> 00:21:14,458
So, now we have a half-open eye.

455
00:21:14,522 --> 00:21:17,185
We use this design for hollow characters.

456
00:21:17,489 --> 00:21:20,927
Now, I'll make the eyes a bit slanted.

457
00:21:28,509 --> 00:21:31,599
These eyes are often used for female characters that look like a cat.

458
00:21:32,006 --> 00:21:33,425
I'll raise it.

459
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:36,239
It goes a bit outwards, then goes downwards.

460
00:21:36,949 --> 00:21:38,278
So it would look like this.

461
00:21:43,255 --> 00:21:46,996
Again, this eye is often used for female characters that look like a cat.

462
00:21:47,021 --> 00:21:49,800
Now, we can slant the eyes upwards

463
00:21:49,825 --> 00:21:52,247
or downwards.

464
00:21:52,993 --> 00:21:54,693
If they go downwards,

465
00:21:55,825 --> 00:21:57,357
the character will look more gentle.

466
00:21:59,674 --> 00:22:00,474
Like this.

467
00:22:03,216 --> 00:22:04,387
Usually in this case,

468
00:22:04,412 --> 00:22:05,597
depending on the designer,

469
00:22:05,622 --> 00:22:07,575
some people draw their eyes like this.

470
00:22:08,318 --> 00:22:11,436
Of course, the eyes may look weird in some cases.

471
00:22:11,461 --> 00:22:12,861
They might look old-fashioned.

472
00:22:12,885 --> 00:22:14,669
So you do it on a case-by-case basis.

473
00:22:21,096 --> 00:22:22,057
Like this,

474
00:22:22,776 --> 00:22:23,667
and

475
00:22:25,018 --> 00:22:26,663
in this case it looks more gentle

476
00:22:26,688 --> 00:22:28,604
if you lower the ends of the eyes.

477
00:22:28,659 --> 00:22:31,409
In this case, even the bottom line can be omitted.

478
00:22:36,302 --> 00:22:37,948
You've seen this before, right?

479
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:45,120
So, the character would look very gentle.

480
00:22:47,776 --> 00:22:50,479
If you look at another example,

481
00:22:53,112 --> 00:22:56,376
this would be usually applied to male characters.

482
00:22:56,401 --> 00:22:58,150
Here, you would modify the lower area.

483
00:22:58,152 --> 00:23:00,439
So far, we modified only the upper area.

484
00:23:00,464 --> 00:23:02,079
So, now, let's modify the lower area.

485
00:23:02,104 --> 00:23:04,595
This could also be related to expressions.

486
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:07,971
When you push the lower curve upwards,

487
00:23:09,674 --> 00:23:12,500
the character tends to have a sharper impression.

488
00:23:12,667 --> 00:23:15,077
It would be much sharper

489
00:23:15,101 --> 00:23:16,198
than the eye I drew above.

490
00:23:16,223 --> 00:23:18,628
And it looks more masculine.

491
00:23:18,917 --> 00:23:21,496
And, if we raise this lower part upwards,

492
00:23:22,305 --> 00:23:25,276
it will look as if the character's frowning.

493
00:23:27,534 --> 00:23:28,940
Like this.

494
00:23:30,174 --> 00:23:33,159
Other than these, we can create many different eyes.

495
00:23:33,221 --> 00:23:35,565
Some people draw square shaped eyes.

496
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:39,696
There are also people

497
00:23:39,721 --> 00:23:42,557
who draw eyes as round as possible, without drawing all these lines.

498
00:23:44,085 --> 00:23:45,531
There are many scenarios.

499
00:23:49,813 --> 00:23:51,307
But, although there are many scenarios,

500
00:23:51,332 --> 00:23:54,235
your character would look different depending on

501
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,702
how you express these lines.

502
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:58,267
So, you should expand what you can express.

503
00:23:58,269 --> 00:24:01,350
Practice drawing different eye shapes

504
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:03,362
and use them

505
00:24:03,364 --> 00:24:05,242
according to your needs.

506
00:24:05,836 --> 00:24:07,582
So, you can draw a character's eyes

507
00:24:07,606 --> 00:24:09,264
like this.

508
00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:10,233
What was the important point?

509
00:24:10,258 --> 00:24:11,686
The first one was the eye socket.

510
00:24:11,711 --> 00:24:14,399
This three-dimensional shape is really important, so please remember it well.

511
00:24:14,517 --> 00:24:19,594
The second was the structure of the eyes and the patterns.

512
00:24:21,117 --> 00:24:22,633
And the third one,

513
00:24:23,002 --> 00:24:25,883
would be the pupil.

514
00:24:26,242 --> 00:24:28,688
They said the pupils look like this.

515
00:24:28,781 --> 00:24:30,539
There's something important here.

516
00:24:31,055 --> 00:24:33,428
There's a part that we usually express as pupils.

517
00:24:33,453 --> 00:24:34,828
This spot in the middle

518
00:24:35,063 --> 00:24:38,711
is where your pupils go.

519
00:24:41,671 --> 00:24:42,910
It's a spot like this.

520
00:24:42,935 --> 00:24:45,133
So, the shape goes inwards.

521
00:24:45,308 --> 00:24:46,860
Why is this important?

522
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:50,094
When the character

523
00:24:52,922 --> 00:24:54,680
looks to the left,

524
00:24:55,644 --> 00:24:58,156
the eye will look like this.

525
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:05,109
So, many people

526
00:25:05,121 --> 00:25:07,467
just draw the pupil at the center.

527
00:25:07,492 --> 00:25:10,802
But, it won't look three-dimensional this way.

528
00:25:11,445 --> 00:25:13,041
To draw accurately,

529
00:25:13,043 --> 00:25:15,266
let's make the pupils a bit thick,

530
00:25:15,383 --> 00:25:16,930
around this much.

531
00:25:17,721 --> 00:25:20,274
So, now we would draw the pupil,

532
00:25:22,735 --> 00:25:23,375
like this.

533
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,280
If you do this,

534
00:25:26,305 --> 00:25:28,774
you can draw a more three-dimensional face.

535
00:25:28,883 --> 00:25:31,985
Of course, we apply deformers to this area.

536
00:25:32,211 --> 00:25:33,347
What is it?

537
00:25:33,349 --> 00:25:35,844
We would slightly modify the drawing.

538
00:25:36,047 --> 00:25:38,518
For example, if you want to draw a character that looks to the left.

539
00:25:39,313 --> 00:25:41,147
In that case,

540
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:42,695
although it does look like

541
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,215
it's looking to the left,

542
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,367
it's not too clear.

543
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:49,286
So to fix that issue,

544
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,848
to make it more clear,

545
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:53,774
you may express it like this.

546
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:56,149
So it looks more clear.

547
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,875
You can do that, but basically, it goes inwards.

548
00:25:59,974 --> 00:26:03,781
Keep in mind that the pupil is located like that.

549
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,539
I'll tell you one more thing.

550
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:08,867
The gaze.

551
00:26:09,797 --> 00:26:11,363
When we draw the character's gaze,

552
00:26:11,388 --> 00:26:13,238
many people make mistakes here.

553
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,850
Some of you may have felt like

554
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:18,059
your character's eyes are cross-eyed.

555
00:26:18,061 --> 00:26:21,477
This especially happens when you are drawing the character's face from the front.

556
00:26:21,656 --> 00:26:23,631
If you draw the face, the character's eyes could be cross-eyed.

557
00:26:23,656 --> 00:26:25,188
Why does that happen?

558
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,013
Because we actually draw cross-eyes.

559
00:26:30,307 --> 00:26:32,313
If you look at people's gaze,

560
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:36,781
when people perceive an object,

561
00:26:37,242 --> 00:26:41,141
it means their eyes come into focus.

562
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:43,883
When you were young, you might have seen friends

563
00:26:43,908 --> 00:26:46,423
who put out a finger and stare at it

564
00:26:46,448 --> 00:26:47,688
to become cross-eyed.

565
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:54,430
So, your gaze will meet somewhere at a certain point.

566
00:26:54,774 --> 00:26:56,567
That would mean our eyes

567
00:26:56,591 --> 00:26:58,327
are always a bit cross-eyed.

568
00:26:58,329 --> 00:27:01,102
If they're looking at the same place, that itself is an error.

569
00:27:02,803 --> 00:27:03,594
Therefore,

570
00:27:04,612 --> 00:27:06,086
in a half-sided state...

571
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:08,899
In this state,

572
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,836
let's say it's looking to the right.

573
00:27:12,313 --> 00:27:15,188
Let's say you look to the right, about this point.

574
00:27:16,432 --> 00:27:19,753
This eye on the right moves a bit.

575
00:27:20,824 --> 00:27:23,117
On the other hand, the left eye

576
00:27:24,117 --> 00:27:25,967
has to match the spot right here.

577
00:27:25,992 --> 00:27:28,844
It has to stick to the wall and go in like this.

578
00:27:29,727 --> 00:27:32,358
So this eye has an outer wall on the right side

579
00:27:32,383 --> 00:27:35,203
This means that the outer wall should not be left on the right side.

580
00:27:35,406 --> 00:27:38,149
"You have to look at both eyes in the same way."

581
00:27:38,174 --> 00:27:40,342
The people who drew it like this

582
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,500
may have experienced that it's hard to see the direction of the face.

583
00:27:42,992 --> 00:27:45,174
It kind of becomes cross-eyed.

584
00:27:45,186 --> 00:27:46,516
I'm sure you've experienced it before.

585
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,394
So to prevent that,

586
00:27:49,396 --> 00:27:51,500
I'm going to overlap this gaze in one place,

587
00:27:52,227 --> 00:27:55,938
so the fact that they allow them to meet in one place

588
00:27:55,963 --> 00:27:57,246
becomes clear.

589
00:27:57,461 --> 00:27:59,453
That was the eyeball part.

590
00:27:59,997 --> 00:28:03,334
The next thing you need to look at is both the nose and the mouth.

591
00:28:05,997 --> 00:28:10,203
The nose is also the most omitted part of the casual style.

592
00:28:11,024 --> 00:28:12,024
I often

593
00:28:12,049 --> 00:28:15,194
said the eye part is the part that we apply the deformers to the most.

594
00:28:15,219 --> 00:28:16,742
That's what I said...

595
00:28:16,744 --> 00:28:20,297
This is almost the same as the eye part.

596
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:23,233
Or, depending on how you interpret it,

597
00:28:23,258 --> 00:28:25,715
The part where deformers go in more than the eyes is the nose.

598
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,188
What it means is that we don't draw it without appropriate details.

599
00:28:28,213 --> 00:28:30,740
The nose is normally very complicated.

600
00:28:30,765 --> 00:28:33,414
If you look at the actual nose,

601
00:28:34,623 --> 00:28:36,774
It looks like this.

602
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:40,030
To be honest,

603
00:28:40,055 --> 00:28:41,561
if I just draw it as it is,

604
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:45,045
it'd look very ugly.

605
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:47,022
Depending on the person who expresses the nose,

606
00:28:47,047 --> 00:28:49,274
Some people said it looks like an alien.

607
00:28:49,797 --> 00:28:52,883
Then how could you make the nose look casual?

608
00:28:52,885 --> 00:28:56,594
I'll talk about the age group.

609
00:28:58,617 --> 00:29:01,311
Here it's a question of impressions.

610
00:29:01,336 --> 00:29:02,742
I'm going to draw two characters.

611
00:29:02,767 --> 00:29:05,719
Let's guess which one looks younger.

612
00:29:05,805 --> 00:29:07,024
In the first case,

613
00:29:07,422 --> 00:29:08,628
I will raise the eyebrows

614
00:29:08,652 --> 00:29:10,485
as much as I can.

615
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:13,435
And I'm going to put the nose as close as possible to the eyes.

616
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,289
I'm going to put the lips there as much as I can.

617
00:29:16,194 --> 00:29:17,336
Now, the second case.

618
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:18,752
In the second case,

619
00:29:18,776 --> 00:29:20,367
I'm going to add some eyebrows.

620
00:29:21,193 --> 00:29:23,844
And lower the nose and mouth as much as possible.

621
00:29:26,148 --> 00:29:28,298
Between the two, which one looks more mature?

622
00:29:28,944 --> 00:29:31,105
When you put it down like this,

623
00:29:31,516 --> 00:29:32,633
no matter how many times I look at it,

624
00:29:32,899 --> 00:29:35,828
among these characters

625
00:29:36,802 --> 00:29:39,705
If you look at them, the one on the right looks like a dad.

626
00:29:43,001 --> 00:29:44,414
And this one is the baby.

627
00:29:46,308 --> 00:29:47,656
It's going to be like that.

628
00:29:48,297 --> 00:29:49,480
What I'm saying is

629
00:29:49,505 --> 00:29:51,820
the distance between the eyes and eyebrows is far.

630
00:29:51,953 --> 00:29:54,397
The closer the nose and mouth are to the eyes,

631
00:29:54,422 --> 00:29:55,840
the cuter the impression.

632
00:29:55,842 --> 00:29:57,658
And as the face gets smaller,

633
00:29:57,683 --> 00:30:00,516
and the head gets bigger, the cuter it becomes.

634
00:30:00,617 --> 00:30:01,741
In other words,

635
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:04,492
the smaller the head and the bigger the face,

636
00:30:04,922 --> 00:30:06,742
the closer the eyes and eyebrows are,

637
00:30:07,399 --> 00:30:09,999
and the farther the eyes, nose, and mouth are,

638
00:30:10,024 --> 00:30:11,555
that makes the character look more mature.

639
00:30:12,203 --> 00:30:13,256
So, at this time,

640
00:30:13,281 --> 00:30:14,358
with the expression of the nose,

641
00:30:14,383 --> 00:30:16,242
sometimes there might be some slight differences.

642
00:30:16,534 --> 00:30:17,932
Let me give you an example.

643
00:30:20,184 --> 00:30:21,500
When I have this face,

644
00:30:24,983 --> 00:30:26,305
and

645
00:30:28,086 --> 00:30:30,647
if you want to make it look younger,

646
00:30:30,672 --> 00:30:33,813
and express it in the nose, it'll look like this.

647
00:30:34,063 --> 00:30:35,094
In this line,

648
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:39,008
which one do you think is more effective, the upper or the lower?

649
00:30:39,622 --> 00:30:41,235
The answer is the upper side.

650
00:30:42,102 --> 00:30:45,132
I'm going to draw the upper part of the nose.

651
00:30:45,157 --> 00:30:47,428
So to help the eyes to get closer,

652
00:30:47,453 --> 00:30:48,973
I used the baby's case,

653
00:30:48,998 --> 00:30:50,689
the one on the top left.

654
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,835
If you make it this close,

655
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,649
it gives the impression that the character looks younger.

656
00:30:57,008 --> 00:30:58,048
On the other side,

657
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:00,922
I'll take this character's face shape.

658
00:31:04,579 --> 00:31:07,538
And I'm going to bring it here and make up the lower part.

659
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:11,967
Create the lower part,

660
00:31:11,992 --> 00:31:14,195
and if you lower the nose a bit,

661
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:21,624
even though we were at the same face,

662
00:31:21,657 --> 00:31:24,453
you'll be able to see that it looks more mature.

663
00:31:25,501 --> 00:31:27,117
If you draw the mouth like this,

664
00:31:27,953 --> 00:31:29,547
even when you didn't change the proportion

665
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,492
and the face shape,

666
00:31:31,517 --> 00:31:33,836
you'll be able to see the change in the character's impression.

667
00:31:33,985 --> 00:31:36,311
Like this, the deformers on the nose,

668
00:31:36,336 --> 00:31:39,139
depending on what kind of impression you want to give,

669
00:31:39,164 --> 00:31:42,918
the part you give the impression to would change.

670
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,389
When it comes to if you should divide it into cases,

671
00:31:45,414 --> 00:31:47,687
some people draw it like a triangle,

672
00:31:49,143 --> 00:31:51,024
and I said the nose looks like this before.

673
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:56,555
This is the first case.

674
00:31:57,085 --> 00:31:58,257
Some people draw it like this.

675
00:31:59,321 --> 00:32:02,828
Or others use shapes to draw the side of the nose.

676
00:32:05,195 --> 00:32:08,860
So the second case is to express the top of the nose.

677
00:32:09,141 --> 00:32:10,170
The third case,

678
00:32:10,195 --> 00:32:12,309
is that only the lower side of the nose is expressed.

679
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:14,096
The fourth case,

680
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,601
is a case where you draw the sides and nostrils together.

681
00:32:16,874 --> 00:32:18,625
This is used a lot when you draw half side.

682
00:32:18,789 --> 00:32:20,360
You've probably seen this line before.

683
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:22,703
Something like this.

684
00:32:23,797 --> 00:32:24,889
The fifth case

685
00:32:24,921 --> 00:32:26,697
is the one with both nostrils.

686
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:28,602
Some people draw it like this.

687
00:32:30,966 --> 00:32:32,616
The difference from this one is

688
00:32:32,641 --> 00:32:34,891
one side of this here stands up a bit more.

689
00:32:35,225 --> 00:32:36,586
This is the center of the nose.

690
00:32:37,409 --> 00:32:39,031
Usually, the cases are divided like this.

691
00:32:39,172 --> 00:32:41,914
You can control the character's age by choosing one.

692
00:32:43,703 --> 00:32:45,406
Now, the mouth.

693
00:32:45,477 --> 00:32:47,053
You don't have to make the mouth big.

694
00:32:47,078 --> 00:32:48,239
Deformers are applied a lot

695
00:32:48,263 --> 00:32:50,281
in this part.

696
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:51,951
Depending on how you use them,

697
00:32:51,967 --> 00:32:53,004
no matter what part of the face it is,

698
00:32:53,016 --> 00:32:54,710
deformers can be applied a lot.

699
00:32:54,958 --> 00:32:56,922
You may have seen this in casual characters,

700
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,753
like this one.

701
00:33:00,344 --> 00:33:03,219
This character's mouth is attached to the side.

702
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:05,051
Since the center of the face is here,

703
00:33:05,075 --> 00:33:06,789
this makes the mouth really crooked.

704
00:33:06,814 --> 00:33:08,524
There's a hole next to the mouth.

705
00:33:08,828 --> 00:33:11,182
So if you watch it in 3D, it'll look really ugly.

706
00:33:11,184 --> 00:33:13,367
But this works in 2D illustrations.

707
00:33:13,392 --> 00:33:14,227
So you can use it.

708
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,511
You can apply deformers a lot in this section.

709
00:33:17,513 --> 00:33:19,316
Then what do you need to know from the mouth section?

710
00:33:19,318 --> 00:33:20,930
Let's move on after getting the basics.

711
00:33:21,268 --> 00:33:24,203
For female characters, it's based on the inner part of the eye.

712
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:28,280
The size of the mouth would be

713
00:33:28,305 --> 00:33:30,641
as much as you can fit on the inner side.

714
00:33:30,829 --> 00:33:34,008
If it's bigger than this, the mouth looks too big.

715
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,383
For the male character,

716
00:33:35,485 --> 00:33:38,117
the standard for adult males is the center of both eyes.

717
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:39,405
Literally at the center.

718
00:33:39,603 --> 00:33:43,943
But it's better to push it in a little bit.

719
00:33:43,968 --> 00:33:45,857
So it would suit the character more.

720
00:33:46,375 --> 00:33:47,460
So that's about it.

721
00:33:47,485 --> 00:33:49,375
By keeping the size,

722
00:33:50,311 --> 00:33:52,521
You can adjust the deformers.

723
00:33:52,546 --> 00:33:54,360
When you adjust the deformers for the mouth,

724
00:33:55,395 --> 00:33:57,724
let's look at the cases for this, too.

725
00:33:59,986 --> 00:34:01,686
A case that only expresses the upper teeth.

726
00:34:02,497 --> 00:34:04,970
And one that expresses the lower lip only,

727
00:34:05,781 --> 00:34:08,633
these are the cases that come up often.

728
00:34:09,019 --> 00:34:11,469
And if you loosen up the deformers,

729
00:34:14,281 --> 00:34:17,344
there's a case for expressing the three-dimensional effect of the teeth.

730
00:34:20,917 --> 00:34:23,020
And there's the case where you draw the lower teeth as well.

731
00:34:24,822 --> 00:34:26,703
If I loosen it up a bit more,

732
00:34:28,203 --> 00:34:30,055
it goes into the shape of the teeth.

733
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:34,375
Or you can just depict the fangs on this side,

734
00:34:42,115 --> 00:34:43,039
like this.

735
00:34:45,123 --> 00:34:48,406
But the nose and eyes don't come out very well.

736
00:34:48,408 --> 00:34:50,893
But the deformers that come up often in the mouth,

737
00:34:51,331 --> 00:34:52,815
I'm sure you've seen this a lot.

738
00:34:53,803 --> 00:34:54,659
A sharp tooth.

739
00:34:59,545 --> 00:35:02,339
There are cases where there is a lot of deformation in the teeth,

740
00:35:03,173 --> 00:35:05,870
or even if it's a pointy tooth, I'll loosen up the deformers.

741
00:35:06,093 --> 00:35:08,417
Some people try to make it realistic.

742
00:35:10,902 --> 00:35:14,042
Or there's a mouth that has a lot of deformers in it.

743
00:35:16,797 --> 00:35:19,401
The teeth look good in this mouth.

744
00:35:19,698 --> 00:35:22,109
There will be different patterns

745
00:35:22,133 --> 00:35:23,617
but it could be like this.

746
00:35:24,448 --> 00:35:27,776
The important thing is a standard for a mouth Deformer.

747
00:35:28,055 --> 00:35:31,243
If you followed the standard, then the Deformer would be very free.

748
00:35:31,268 --> 00:35:33,457
If there's a character you want to draw who is aged,

749
00:35:33,482 --> 00:35:35,729
then you would draw its mouth with fewer deformers applied.

750
00:35:37,892 --> 00:35:40,573
And if you want to draw a younger character,

751
00:35:40,598 --> 00:35:42,440
and if you use a mouth with a lot of deformers applied,

752
00:35:43,148 --> 00:35:45,651
you'll be able to fit in.

753
00:35:46,192 --> 00:35:50,737
That was a brief introduction to the eyes, nose, and lips.

754
00:35:50,847 --> 00:35:54,440
Ears are just legitimate ears.

755
00:35:54,859 --> 00:35:56,581
You can practice while looking at the pictures.

756
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:01,602
It's called the inner ear flap.

757
00:36:01,604 --> 00:36:04,972
I'm going to express the ear flap to a certain extent.

758
00:36:15,437 --> 00:36:18,428
Some people have protruding parts under their ears,

759
00:36:18,453 --> 00:36:20,659
but people don't use this part for a casual character.

760
00:36:21,065 --> 00:36:23,643
I think you can recognize that it's enough to draw.

761
00:36:23,788 --> 00:36:25,551
Let me tell you something important.

762
00:36:25,576 --> 00:36:28,110
It's a three-dimensional part that the ears stick to.

763
00:36:28,112 --> 00:36:29,745
When you look at the face from the top,

764
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:33,120
the part with the ears is diagonally attached.

765
00:36:33,145 --> 00:36:34,917
It's not attached like this.

766
00:36:35,338 --> 00:36:37,323
There are people who get confused with this.

767
00:36:37,348 --> 00:36:39,995
Let's be careful not to make a mistake.

768
00:36:41,511 --> 00:36:45,940
So, now, we finished the overall shape of the head,

769
00:36:46,573 --> 00:36:48,364
and the cuboid shape of the head,

770
00:36:48,366 --> 00:36:52,147
and the overall features of the face.

771
00:36:52,149 --> 00:36:54,025
While assembling this,

772
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:56,784
you need to be able to see the details of the face shape.

773
00:36:56,987 --> 00:36:59,472
We didn't go through much of the face shape yet.

774
00:36:59,764 --> 00:37:01,050
Let's take a look at it.

775
00:37:12,052 --> 00:37:13,732
Like we did before,

776
00:37:14,396 --> 00:37:16,779
I'm going to make the basic shape of the head.

777
00:37:21,577 --> 00:37:24,732
Draw the center line here.

778
00:37:30,129 --> 00:37:32,599
It'd be nice if you widen the top here.

779
00:37:33,598 --> 00:37:35,670
Make the back a little wider as well.

780
00:37:36,818 --> 00:37:38,128
If you get to draw a casual character's

781
00:37:38,153 --> 00:37:41,091
basic head shape,

782
00:37:45,932 --> 00:37:47,848
now you will be able to apply

783
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,607
the facial features easily.

784
00:37:50,037 --> 00:37:52,103
But there might be one thing that makes you get stuck here.

785
00:37:52,128 --> 00:37:53,420
It's the perspective.

786
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,772
It's so hard to apply perspective to the face.

787
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,473
I meet a lot of people with this issue.

788
00:37:58,498 --> 00:37:59,496
So when that happens,

789
00:37:59,521 --> 00:38:02,098
how could you overcome this?

790
00:38:02,123 --> 00:38:04,037
I'll tell you briefly.

791
00:38:07,434 --> 00:38:10,326
The basic shape of the eyes...

792
00:38:10,351 --> 00:38:12,107
let's use the eyes.

793
00:38:13,388 --> 00:38:16,177
I'm going to draw this eye at a low angle.

794
00:38:16,441 --> 00:38:17,826
How should you draw it?

795
00:38:24,767 --> 00:38:25,888
If you draw it like this,

796
00:38:28,296 --> 00:38:29,138
it's done.

797
00:38:30,692 --> 00:38:32,964
You might think, "What is this?"

798
00:38:33,198 --> 00:38:34,365
That's what's important.

799
00:38:34,366 --> 00:38:36,095
The line which was straight here,

800
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,293
bends down here.

801
00:38:38,456 --> 00:38:40,775
Just to let you know, the base of this line is

802
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:42,487
the line I drew on the face.

803
00:38:43,808 --> 00:38:45,603
We drew the center line once before.

804
00:38:45,628 --> 00:38:48,362
This line itself is the center of the eyes.

805
00:38:48,456 --> 00:38:50,241
If this part bends like this,

806
00:38:50,265 --> 00:38:51,925
then apply it to the other part of the eye as well.

807
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,659
Please bend it at the same angle.

808
00:38:53,909 --> 00:38:55,151
One, two

809
00:38:57,834 --> 00:38:59,066
and then

810
00:39:01,667 --> 00:39:02,664
to fit the angle,

811
00:39:02,666 --> 00:39:04,751
just understand it as

812
00:39:04,753 --> 00:39:06,878
giving different 'levels' to the curvature.

813
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:08,401
What I'm saying is,

814
00:39:08,487 --> 00:39:11,003
for example, I basically drew this line

815
00:39:11,964 --> 00:39:14,159
so when there's no perspective applied inside,

816
00:39:14,184 --> 00:39:15,683
and when it's level zero,

817
00:39:16,013 --> 00:39:18,049
the lower the angle,

818
00:39:18,051 --> 00:39:19,800
then it becomes level 1.

819
00:39:19,901 --> 00:39:23,191
The higher the angle is,

820
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:25,291
let's say it's becomes level one.

821
00:39:25,316 --> 00:39:27,269
So, I added a low angle.

822
00:39:27,271 --> 00:39:30,401
Then, this line will be loosened like this.

823
00:39:32,695 --> 00:39:35,049
Then let's say it's in a very low angle.

824
00:39:35,051 --> 00:39:37,964
Then, this line will be flipped at that point.

825
00:39:39,714 --> 00:39:42,581
On the other hand, suppose you saw this line as a high angle.

826
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:44,550
Then, you'll have to dig a little lower.

827
00:39:45,737 --> 00:39:47,456
Then, if you thought it was a higher angle,

828
00:39:47,481 --> 00:39:49,167
then you'll get a lot of holes down there.

829
00:39:50,408 --> 00:39:51,941
It changes like this.

830
00:39:52,113 --> 00:39:54,298
So, you would modify these lines a bit

831
00:39:54,323 --> 00:39:56,066
depending on how much

832
00:39:56,091 --> 00:39:58,542
the low angle is applied.

833
00:39:58,567 --> 00:40:01,691
So, think of dividing them into different levels.

834
00:40:02,327 --> 00:40:04,339
If you look at the numbers here,

835
00:40:04,514 --> 00:40:07,245
let's approach it like math.

836
00:40:07,662 --> 00:40:11,159
The eyes are at a low angle of level 2.

837
00:40:15,812 --> 00:40:17,725
And this eye is basically straight.

838
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:20,245
So, it's close to Level 0. And 0+2 is 2.

839
00:40:20,396 --> 00:40:22,878
So, this one is on Level 2, and there is a low angle applied.

840
00:40:26,284 --> 00:40:28,767
This line goes down a little bit.

841
00:40:28,792 --> 00:40:31,417
So, this eye's angle is at Minus level 1.

842
00:40:31,598 --> 00:40:33,197
Then, here, I'll apply level 2

843
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,596
to this angle, too.

844
00:40:34,769 --> 00:40:36,696
Then what's Minus level 1 plus level 2?

845
00:40:36,698 --> 00:40:37,737
It's level 1.

846
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:40,987
Then, let's use the line that's a bit loose.

847
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:45,995
Instead of that, you would draw it as

848
00:40:46,245 --> 00:40:48,283
a line that's headed to the center a bit.

849
00:40:48,308 --> 00:40:49,331
So, it would be level 1.

850
00:40:49,573 --> 00:40:50,861
If you think about it that way,

851
00:40:50,886 --> 00:40:52,347
when you apply the angle,

852
00:40:52,372 --> 00:40:54,597
it'll be easier to apply.

853
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:02,143
Now then,

854
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,058
if the eyes with the low angle

855
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:05,534
look like this,

856
00:41:05,979 --> 00:41:07,831
then we need to draw eyes with a high angle as well.

857
00:41:07,856 --> 00:41:09,589
It's the opposite, so it's about the same.

858
00:41:12,684 --> 00:41:14,443
It's not that different.

859
00:41:19,482 --> 00:41:21,058
You can draw it like this.

860
00:41:23,271 --> 00:41:25,159
Even when you can just draw the basic type,

861
00:41:25,909 --> 00:41:27,356
and if you

862
00:41:27,358 --> 00:41:29,066
want to give this kind of impression,

863
00:41:30,146 --> 00:41:31,964
remember the gentle eye that we drew previously?

864
00:41:33,775 --> 00:41:35,436
How would this eye be different from that?

865
00:41:35,438 --> 00:41:38,556
I said this side is just a straight line, so it's level 0.

866
00:41:38,588 --> 00:41:40,549
But this is already dug up.

867
00:41:40,866 --> 00:41:44,050
Let's say it has a level 1 line.

868
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:48,831
I applied this low angle here.

869
00:41:48,856 --> 00:41:50,441
Then it'll be level 3.

870
00:41:51,006 --> 00:41:53,667
When you look at the same angle,

871
00:41:53,669 --> 00:41:55,339
it goes up a bit higher.

872
00:41:57,310 --> 00:42:00,019
On the other hand, since it's expressed in a straight line,

873
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:01,612
similar to this line,

874
00:42:02,029 --> 00:42:02,788
like this,

875
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:12,519
this is how the low angle is applied.

876
00:42:14,689 --> 00:42:18,133
You can apply various facial expressions.

877
00:42:18,445 --> 00:42:20,062
So when you put in the high angle...

878
00:42:20,087 --> 00:42:21,407
On the other hand, compared to this eye,

879
00:42:21,707 --> 00:42:23,297
we need to dig a bit more.

880
00:42:24,146 --> 00:42:25,087
We should put it in.

881
00:42:26,538 --> 00:42:27,712
By using this,

882
00:42:29,237 --> 00:42:31,016
you can practice a lot.

883
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:36,860
Now we get to apply the facial features like this.

884
00:42:37,487 --> 00:42:38,805
The next one is what we've done earlier.

885
00:42:38,932 --> 00:42:40,616
Let's take a look at the face shape.

886
00:42:41,365 --> 00:42:44,610
I told you about the face shape.

887
00:42:44,921 --> 00:42:46,516
Let's just look into it briefly.

888
00:42:46,815 --> 00:42:47,657
First of all,

889
00:42:49,663 --> 00:42:50,688
the eyelids.

890
00:42:51,695 --> 00:42:54,368
As I said before, in the overall structure of the eyes

891
00:42:54,571 --> 00:42:56,883
like this, the eyebrows stick out.

892
00:42:57,063 --> 00:42:59,225
And the eyes look like they're in the center.

893
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:02,149
Therefore, this part of the face is also exposed on the outer line.

894
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:05,735
I'm slightly looking towards the top of the forehead.

895
00:43:05,915 --> 00:43:07,793
It's not completely vertical,

896
00:43:07,795 --> 00:43:10,516
but it's like looking up.

897
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:13,204
It's important to draw it flat.

898
00:43:13,399 --> 00:43:15,728
When we hit our friend's forehead,

899
00:43:15,753 --> 00:43:17,022
it makes a clapping sound.

900
00:43:17,047 --> 00:43:18,241
Why would there be a clapping sound?

901
00:43:18,266 --> 00:43:20,239
If your forehead is round, you can't make a clapping sound.

902
00:43:20,241 --> 00:43:21,313
We can hear the sound.

903
00:43:21,753 --> 00:43:23,946
The reason why there's a clapping sound when you hit your forehead

904
00:43:23,971 --> 00:43:27,415
is because it looks flat.

905
00:43:34,787 --> 00:43:37,118
I'm going to express the cheekbones.

906
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:41,676
Some people say cheekbones stick out like this.

907
00:43:41,678 --> 00:43:44,170
People don't emphasize the cheekbones in casual characters.

908
00:43:44,373 --> 00:43:46,653
So, people often don't express

909
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:48,272
cheekbones a lot.

910
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,147
You can think of it as lowering it vertically.

911
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,442
Lowering it down like that,

912
00:43:53,467 --> 00:43:55,225
we have a chin.

913
00:43:55,879 --> 00:43:58,389
The chin is slightly lower than the ears.

914
00:43:58,414 --> 00:43:59,451
From this point,

915
00:44:00,698 --> 00:44:02,123
on the chin below,

916
00:44:02,381 --> 00:44:05,357
it usually starts a little above the center.

917
00:44:05,539 --> 00:44:07,490
Some people put it down to the center,

918
00:44:08,019 --> 00:44:10,592
from about 1/3 of the point,

919
00:44:11,897 --> 00:44:14,177
it goes down steeply like this.

920
00:44:14,202 --> 00:44:15,958
The chin is basically straight.

921
00:44:15,983 --> 00:44:17,316
When you draw the chin,

922
00:44:17,328 --> 00:44:19,334
don't think of it as a curve.

923
00:44:19,546 --> 00:44:22,334
When you draw a character's face, you have to draw it in a circle.

924
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:23,623
You can't cut the bones.

925
00:44:24,018 --> 00:44:25,877
Why does this side look so round?

926
00:44:25,901 --> 00:44:26,951
When you look at it from the front,

927
00:44:28,115 --> 00:44:30,427
the reason why the chin looks round

928
00:44:30,452 --> 00:44:31,667
and the reason why the cheeks are sticking out

929
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:34,806
is because you are seeing them from a high angle.

930
00:44:35,536 --> 00:44:37,308
So we are looking from this area.

931
00:44:37,333 --> 00:44:38,915
This one is a bit lower.

932
00:44:39,722 --> 00:44:40,821
And it's like a high angle.

933
00:44:40,846 --> 00:44:43,167
Therefore, this side looks a bit more round.

934
00:44:45,113 --> 00:44:47,925
The bone line itself doesn't bend and go in.

935
00:44:48,294 --> 00:44:52,128
So, draw a straight line here.

936
00:44:53,395 --> 00:44:54,636
Basically,

937
00:44:56,925 --> 00:44:58,956
just above

938
00:44:59,424 --> 00:45:02,191
this chin bone,

939
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,299
right around here.

940
00:45:05,324 --> 00:45:06,894
This line marks the point

941
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,783
where the cheek line goes in.

942
00:45:09,808 --> 00:45:12,247
It's the same for this too, it's bent like this.

943
00:45:15,996 --> 00:45:18,081
This is how you get the shape of the face.

944
00:45:23,186 --> 00:45:26,972
We need to draw the nose and lips here.

945
00:45:27,042 --> 00:45:28,878
At this point, I want to say one thing.

946
00:45:28,903 --> 00:45:31,310
I said not to draw the center line if possible.

947
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:33,228
Does that mean you shouldn't draw the center line at all?

948
00:45:33,253 --> 00:45:34,476
No, I told you,

949
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,361
to draw it.

950
00:45:35,386 --> 00:45:37,035
You can draw the center line.

951
00:45:37,131 --> 00:45:39,605
But if you're going to draw it, please draw it in detail.

952
00:45:40,462 --> 00:45:41,595
Starting from here,

953
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:42,830
the bridge of the nose goes in,

954
00:45:42,832 --> 00:45:44,861
and it goes in the center of the eyes.

955
00:45:44,886 --> 00:45:46,036
So the character can wear glasses.

956
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:49,402
And the nose sticks out,

957
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:52,958
and goes in,

958
00:45:53,097 --> 00:45:54,084
and sticks out again.

959
00:45:54,109 --> 00:45:55,095
The lips are pouting out,

960
00:45:55,628 --> 00:45:57,141
the lower lips pout out,

961
00:45:57,143 --> 00:45:58,033
and go in,

962
00:45:58,058 --> 00:45:59,519
and the chin part sticks out a little bit.

963
00:46:00,605 --> 00:46:02,030
Please draw all these lines.

964
00:46:02,032 --> 00:46:03,152
If you're going to draw the center line,

965
00:46:03,389 --> 00:46:04,941
erase it afterwards.

966
00:46:05,282 --> 00:46:07,214
So you can make your drawing style.

967
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:13,033
When you check if the character's head is three-dimensional,

968
00:46:13,058 --> 00:46:14,535
you can check it like that.

969
00:46:16,545 --> 00:46:18,050
That's how it's expressed.

970
00:46:24,253 --> 00:46:26,125
Add the sternocleidomastoid muscle on the neck.

971
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:27,120
In the back of the head,

972
00:46:27,725 --> 00:46:28,933
put your neck together.

973
00:46:30,862 --> 00:46:31,793
So far,

974
00:46:31,818 --> 00:46:32,945
this would be a rough sketch

975
00:46:33,178 --> 00:46:33,920
of one's face.

976
00:46:33,922 --> 00:46:35,220
Now, I'm going to use this.

977
00:46:35,245 --> 00:46:36,925
To approach a face at various angles.

978
00:46:36,991 --> 00:46:38,581
It's a good idea to take a closer look at it.

979
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:41,824
First,

980
00:46:41,937 --> 00:46:43,722
draw a cuboid.

981
00:46:43,995 --> 00:46:44,885
Second,

982
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:46,878
align the facial features.

983
00:46:46,903 --> 00:46:47,761
When you do this,

984
00:46:47,786 --> 00:46:49,589
you know the step of aligning the center line.

985
00:46:49,748 --> 00:46:51,972
It's good to take that step, too.

986
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:53,945
If you look at the eyes,

987
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:54,914
you can see the way we applied perspective

988
00:46:54,938 --> 00:46:56,745
is applied in the same way.

989
00:46:57,864 --> 00:46:58,666
Like this.

990
00:46:58,691 --> 00:47:00,471
It's important that you

991
00:47:00,496 --> 00:47:01,933
become familiar with the head's shape.

992
00:47:02,071 --> 00:47:03,346
If you're finished up to here,

993
00:47:03,371 --> 00:47:05,441
draw the contour lines.

994
00:47:07,902 --> 00:47:09,094
It's what we did.

995
00:47:09,096 --> 00:47:10,267
The facial contour lines.

996
00:47:10,292 --> 00:47:12,144
Be aware of the parts that pop out

997
00:47:12,169 --> 00:47:13,224
and pop in.

998
00:47:13,226 --> 00:47:15,251
Control these areas and draw.

999
00:47:15,586 --> 00:47:16,746
Now that you've done that,

1000
00:47:16,771 --> 00:47:18,480
apply your own deformers

1001
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:20,970
to draw different angles

1002
00:47:20,995 --> 00:47:22,535
and different types

1003
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:25,080
of your characters' faces.

1004
00:47:25,394 --> 00:47:26,363
For the hair,

1005
00:47:26,388 --> 00:47:29,581
I'll go into that in more detail in the next lecture.

1006
00:47:31,425 --> 00:47:33,129
So, today, I'll just go over it

1007
00:47:33,131 --> 00:47:34,378
briefly.

1008
00:47:41,821 --> 00:47:44,256
If we divide the hair into parts,

1009
00:47:44,404 --> 00:47:45,266
there's the front hair,

1010
00:47:45,291 --> 00:47:46,011
the side hair,

1011
00:47:46,013 --> 00:47:47,582
and the back hair.

1012
00:47:47,607 --> 00:47:50,490
The area we usually call

1013
00:47:51,225 --> 00:47:52,420
the sideburns,

1014
00:47:52,665 --> 00:47:54,537
let's say this is the side hair area.

1015
00:47:54,562 --> 00:47:56,662
So, let's say the ear is the starting point.

1016
00:47:58,816 --> 00:48:01,743
Then, at its front, there would be the front hair and the side hair.

1017
00:48:14,729 --> 00:48:15,525
Like this.

1018
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:17,143
I'll draw the front and side hair.

1019
00:48:17,168 --> 00:48:20,151
And you can say that the hair behind the ear

1020
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:21,510
is the back hair.

1021
00:48:22,205 --> 00:48:24,487
I think maintaining this big part,

1022
00:48:24,512 --> 00:48:27,163
would be a stable way to draw the hair.

1023
00:48:27,283 --> 00:48:28,828
Of course, you can part the hair.

1024
00:48:28,853 --> 00:48:30,095
Depending on the hairstyle of the character,

1025
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,002
This part can change a little bit.

1026
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,645
This area doesn't change,

1027
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:35,298
I recommend you remember that.

1028
00:48:35,299 --> 00:48:37,320
Why do you need to remember this?

1029
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:40,526
I'm going to tell you more information in the next class.

1030
00:48:52,504 --> 00:48:53,479
First, like this,

1031
00:48:53,504 --> 00:48:55,603
we went through the way how to draw the face accurately,

1032
00:48:55,605 --> 00:48:56,811
so far.

1033
00:48:56,813 --> 00:49:00,209
Let's learn how to draw beautifully.

1034
00:49:01,817 --> 00:49:03,098
What we learned earlier,

1035
00:49:03,123 --> 00:49:05,645
deformers for the eyes, nose, and lips,

1036
00:49:05,647 --> 00:49:07,848
belong to the essentials of how to draw well.

1037
00:49:07,873 --> 00:49:09,239
Later on, I hope you study

1038
00:49:09,774 --> 00:49:11,739
those parts together.

1039
00:49:11,832 --> 00:49:13,785
To draw a gorgeous face,

1040
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:15,832
as expected, the proportions

1041
00:49:15,857 --> 00:49:17,403
will also play an important role.

1042
00:49:19,228 --> 00:49:20,996
Remember when we drew

1043
00:49:21,021 --> 00:49:22,715
a cute character and an old character?

1044
00:49:23,302 --> 00:49:24,530
We'll use these characters

1045
00:49:24,555 --> 00:49:27,512
to study how to draw.

1046
00:49:28,676 --> 00:49:29,940
Now, the first scenario.

1047
00:49:29,965 --> 00:49:31,887
Let's draw a childlike face.

1048
00:49:32,455 --> 00:49:33,846
If you want to draw a childlike face,

1049
00:49:33,871 --> 00:49:35,864
draw the eyebrows

1050
00:49:43,148 --> 00:49:45,148
slightly high up.

1051
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:53,619
The nose should be

1052
00:49:53,644 --> 00:49:54,963
close to the eyes.

1053
00:49:56,690 --> 00:49:59,244
The face should be small,

1054
00:50:01,122 --> 00:50:03,150
while its head should be big.

1055
00:50:03,175 --> 00:50:04,455
That's the key point.

1056
00:50:15,264 --> 00:50:17,709
Then, we'd have a face that looks like this.

1057
00:50:23,913 --> 00:50:25,553
If you look at the basics,

1058
00:50:30,002 --> 00:50:32,409
it will look like this.

1059
00:50:33,504 --> 00:50:35,316
I'll make the eyebrows pop out.

1060
00:50:39,417 --> 00:50:42,380
Now that we've looked at a young face, let's draw a mature face.

1061
00:50:50,706 --> 00:50:52,469
With mature faces,

1062
00:50:52,669 --> 00:50:55,383
the eye size should be smaller.

1063
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:06,490
I'll modify its gaze.

1064
00:51:10,049 --> 00:51:12,581
Just like I told you, the eyebrows

1065
00:51:12,606 --> 00:51:14,657
would be closer to the eyes.

1066
00:51:15,435 --> 00:51:16,521
Even with female characters,

1067
00:51:16,546 --> 00:51:19,123
it won't be too awkward when the eyebrows are close to the eyes.

1068
00:51:19,349 --> 00:51:20,865
So, when you're drawing a mature character,

1069
00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:22,832
don't be shy and just draw it carefully.

1070
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,365
Some people keep heightening the eyebrows.

1071
00:51:28,194 --> 00:51:31,105
And, with the nose, describe the lower part as much as possible

1072
00:51:31,301 --> 00:51:33,081
and make sure it sticks to the mouth.

1073
00:51:33,463 --> 00:51:35,335
Lengthen the face

1074
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,441
and shorten the head.

1075
00:51:38,717 --> 00:51:40,292
Then, the character would look like

1076
00:51:41,079 --> 00:51:42,917
it is more mature.

1077
00:51:43,472 --> 00:51:46,073
Now, let's create the atmosphere of the character.

1078
00:51:46,098 --> 00:51:48,238
So, what would be the atmosphere of the character?

1079
00:51:48,263 --> 00:51:50,808
It would be the character's first impression.

1080
00:51:51,269 --> 00:51:54,146
When I teach students, I frequently ask them

1081
00:51:54,171 --> 00:51:57,136
whether they are aiming for a cute look or a pretty look.

1082
00:51:59,135 --> 00:52:00,238
So, that means,

1083
00:52:00,495 --> 00:52:01,689
it is good to decide

1084
00:52:01,691 --> 00:52:02,671
whether you're drawing a cute character

1085
00:52:02,673 --> 00:52:04,909
or a pretty character.

1086
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:08,068
And there are different ways of creating them depending on the tone.

1087
00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:09,573
Let's find out more about that.

1088
00:52:10,206 --> 00:52:12,267
Facial deformation is different according to the person.

1089
00:52:12,292 --> 00:52:13,931
I'm just going to tell you

1090
00:52:13,956 --> 00:52:15,597
how to apply deformation.

1091
00:52:15,933 --> 00:52:17,603
What I've told you

1092
00:52:17,628 --> 00:52:19,144
should be treated

1093
00:52:19,169 --> 00:52:20,722
just like parameters.

1094
00:52:20,747 --> 00:52:22,947
You can control

1095
00:52:22,972 --> 00:52:25,800
the amount of deformers depending on how much you want to apply them.

1096
00:52:26,026 --> 00:52:28,777
Now, when you're drawing a cute face,

1097
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:32,597
let's look at the facial features first.

1098
00:52:33,813 --> 00:52:35,683
Eyes, nose, and mouth.

1099
00:52:36,409 --> 00:52:38,253
They make up most of the face.

1100
00:52:38,378 --> 00:52:40,347
Now, let's look at a mature character.

1101
00:52:40,553 --> 00:52:41,378
The eyes,

1102
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:43,106
the nose and the mouth.

1103
00:52:44,696 --> 00:52:46,382
They shrunk quite a lot.

1104
00:52:46,407 --> 00:52:48,363
So, there's a lot of space in the face.

1105
00:52:48,818 --> 00:52:50,839
So, this is where there would be differences in creating the atmosphere.

1106
00:52:51,213 --> 00:52:52,386
What would that mean?

1107
00:52:52,488 --> 00:52:56,091
For us to perceive that a face is pretty,

1108
00:52:56,116 --> 00:52:59,829
we need a lot of information.

1109
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:01,293
In general.

1110
00:53:01,318 --> 00:53:03,078
For example, if you have a lot of eyelashes,

1111
00:53:03,102 --> 00:53:04,589
it would look like a pretty face.

1112
00:53:04,614 --> 00:53:06,628
You need particular features to show

1113
00:53:07,527 --> 00:53:09,236
that you tried to make the face

1114
00:53:09,261 --> 00:53:10,871
look pretty.

1115
00:53:10,873 --> 00:53:13,886
So, that's how we'll perceive the character as being 'pretty'.

1116
00:53:14,091 --> 00:53:15,620
So, we can say that

1117
00:53:16,277 --> 00:53:18,399
a mature character's first impression

1118
00:53:18,401 --> 00:53:20,855
has a kind of disadvantage.

1119
00:53:21,175 --> 00:53:23,636
With the face on the left,

1120
00:53:23,661 --> 00:53:25,618
the facial features already cover most of it.

1121
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:27,397
So, even with a few more descriptions, it will look pretty.

1122
00:53:27,488 --> 00:53:28,839
However, this face on the right

1123
00:53:29,235 --> 00:53:30,791
has small eyes, nose and mouth.

1124
00:53:30,816 --> 00:53:32,785
So, when we add only a few more features,

1125
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:34,753
it won't look like we did much to it.

1126
00:53:34,987 --> 00:53:36,847
So, the solution is simple.

1127
00:53:37,121 --> 00:53:39,011
Depict things in more detail.

1128
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,831
For instance, with eyelashes, you can draw more of them.

1129
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:48,886
Some people draw eyelashes along the dimensions of the face

1130
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:52,917
since eyelashes generally head upwards.

1131
00:53:52,988 --> 00:53:55,120
And they go more outwards.

1132
00:53:55,487 --> 00:53:56,808
Like this.

1133
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:59,189
So, for the eye looking to the left,

1134
00:53:59,191 --> 00:54:01,659
some people make it stick out to the left like this.

1135
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:04,839
Some people make it pop out to the right while it looks to the left.

1136
00:54:04,864 --> 00:54:07,630
There are people who express it like this.

1137
00:54:07,903 --> 00:54:10,113
I prefer the former way.

1138
00:54:12,941 --> 00:54:14,878
The bottom part that I did earlier,

1139
00:54:15,823 --> 00:54:16,823
the eyelashes...

1140
00:54:18,101 --> 00:54:20,772
Some people express the eyes in more detail.

1141
00:54:22,355 --> 00:54:24,429
To make the face look pretty.

1142
00:54:24,454 --> 00:54:27,097
Some people draw stars in the eyes.

1143
00:54:29,691 --> 00:54:31,437
Some people draw them in a shiny way.

1144
00:54:31,461 --> 00:54:33,534
In detail, too.

1145
00:54:33,536 --> 00:54:34,694
In the end,

1146
00:54:34,719 --> 00:54:37,352
to make the face look pretty,

1147
00:54:37,671 --> 00:54:40,016
people often do what I mentioned before.

1148
00:54:40,258 --> 00:54:42,030
To put more information

1149
00:54:42,032 --> 00:54:43,782
into their drawings.

1150
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:48,383
People put in a lot of stuff

1151
00:54:48,684 --> 00:54:49,891
in as detailed a way as possible.

1152
00:54:50,178 --> 00:54:51,961
In the expression of the eyelashes as well.

1153
00:54:56,032 --> 00:54:57,524
What is this close to?

1154
00:54:57,744 --> 00:55:00,935
It's like wearing makeup.

1155
00:55:02,275 --> 00:55:04,675
In that part when people do the actual makeup,

1156
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:06,321
Whether it's blush or anything...

1157
00:55:08,404 --> 00:55:10,180
they put on blush, too.

1158
00:55:10,205 --> 00:55:12,073
They put on eyebrows,

1159
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:14,102
draw eyeliner and make it darker...

1160
00:55:14,156 --> 00:55:15,190
In the end, things like this

1161
00:55:15,192 --> 00:55:17,288
make the eyes look clearer.

1162
00:55:17,313 --> 00:55:19,555
So the key is to make this section look pretty.

1163
00:55:19,907 --> 00:55:22,914
So, if you wanted to make

1164
00:55:22,916 --> 00:55:23,883
this character look pretty,

1165
00:55:23,908 --> 00:55:26,475
the more you focus on the expression,

1166
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:27,711
the better.

1167
00:55:28,076 --> 00:55:30,899
There's a lot of difference between before and after the expressions.

1168
00:55:37,076 --> 00:55:37,821
The lips as well.

1169
00:55:37,846 --> 00:55:39,770
Depending on the person who does it,

1170
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:41,157
some just tint it.

1171
00:55:43,761 --> 00:55:45,421
So when you express this,

1172
00:55:45,446 --> 00:55:47,649
you may apply the deformers on the hair, too.

1173
00:55:47,798 --> 00:55:49,641
If you want to draw a cute character,

1174
00:55:50,265 --> 00:55:51,805
but don't want to make it look pretty...

1175
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:53,774
so if you want it to be cute rather than pretty,

1176
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,836
being pretty and cute are different.

1177
00:55:57,079 --> 00:55:59,426
Of course, some of you might aim for a cute and pretty look.

1178
00:55:59,428 --> 00:56:00,696
Then go for it.

1179
00:56:01,125 --> 00:56:03,125
If you want to make it look

1180
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:06,150
cute and naive

1181
00:56:06,287 --> 00:56:07,547
but don't want to make it look pretty,

1182
00:56:09,937 --> 00:56:11,782
express it simply.

1183
00:56:16,792 --> 00:56:18,016
With the expressions,

1184
00:56:18,634 --> 00:56:19,819
instead of more detailed ones

1185
00:56:19,844 --> 00:56:22,118
like the one before, draw in

1186
00:56:22,303 --> 00:56:23,265
more simple details.

1187
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:25,587
And, like that, the hair should be

1188
00:56:25,589 --> 00:56:29,149
round and big.

1189
00:56:32,219 --> 00:56:33,683
I'll go over this

1190
00:56:33,685 --> 00:56:35,796
more in detail in the next lecture,

1191
00:56:35,821 --> 00:56:36,946
so remember that.

1192
00:56:38,411 --> 00:56:41,423
Make the dimensions really big.

1193
00:56:41,602 --> 00:56:43,682
On the other hand, in this image

1194
00:56:43,707 --> 00:56:44,999
where you would draw a pretty character,

1195
00:56:45,024 --> 00:56:46,430
you will make the dimensions of the hair

1196
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,586
small

1197
00:56:55,306 --> 00:56:56,868
and detailed.

1198
00:57:02,756 --> 00:57:04,231
See how the faces

1199
00:57:04,256 --> 00:57:06,357
on the left and right have a different atmosphere?

1200
00:57:06,717 --> 00:57:07,721
So...

1201
00:57:07,745 --> 00:57:10,223
We came up with a cute character and a pretty character.

1202
00:57:10,225 --> 00:57:11,951
It's the same with male characters.

1203
00:57:12,506 --> 00:57:14,424
A handsome character, and a cute character.

1204
00:57:14,426 --> 00:57:16,020
They all have the same theories behind them.

1205
00:57:16,045 --> 00:57:18,318
With male characters, you won't draw the eyelashes.

1206
00:57:18,765 --> 00:57:20,615
Although some of you may draw these parts.

1207
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,161
So, remember now,

1208
00:57:22,163 --> 00:57:25,217
with male characters, do we use this kind of eyes often?

1209
00:57:26,576 --> 00:57:29,959
When you're drawing a male character,

1210
00:57:29,984 --> 00:57:31,412
they look more handsome when they have smaller eyes.

1211
00:57:35,265 --> 00:57:36,272
Like this.

1212
00:57:57,449 --> 00:57:58,620
Some people

1213
00:57:58,645 --> 00:58:00,265
draw in small dark circles

1214
00:58:00,267 --> 00:58:01,535
in this area here.

1215
00:58:02,570 --> 00:58:04,394
I'll split the hair into small pieces.

1216
00:58:10,213 --> 00:58:11,551
It's depicted like this.

1217
00:58:11,576 --> 00:58:14,347
So I can give a handsome impression.

1218
00:58:16,013 --> 00:58:16,762
So...

1219
00:58:16,787 --> 00:58:18,952
For both male characters and female characters,

1220
00:58:18,977 --> 00:58:20,365
you can adjust the age.

1221
00:58:21,859 --> 00:58:23,105
Let's sort it out.

1222
00:58:23,130 --> 00:58:25,511
The face is

1223
00:58:25,558 --> 00:58:27,397
a very important part of a painting.

1224
00:58:27,422 --> 00:58:29,890
For those who are going for a casual style,

1225
00:58:29,915 --> 00:58:31,245
you have to wrap yourself up and work hard.

1226
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:35,019
It's a section that will continue to play an important role in the human body.

1227
00:58:35,297 --> 00:58:37,575
The first thing that's important when it comes to the face is

1228
00:58:37,577 --> 00:58:38,549
you have to draw it accurately.

1229
00:58:38,551 --> 00:58:39,345
Second,

1230
00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:40,296
draw it prettily.

1231
00:58:40,298 --> 00:58:41,806
I'm sure it's the same for the human body.

1232
00:58:42,027 --> 00:58:43,468
That's important.

1233
00:58:43,527 --> 00:58:44,947
To do that,

1234
00:58:44,972 --> 00:58:45,656
first,

1235
00:58:45,681 --> 00:58:47,718
to make it more accurate, the emphasized parts are

1236
00:58:47,742 --> 00:58:48,597
the head shape

1237
00:58:49,495 --> 00:58:51,830
and the facial features

1238
00:58:51,855 --> 00:58:52,980
including each part,

1239
00:58:53,005 --> 00:58:55,436
especially the eye socket for the eyes.

1240
00:58:55,461 --> 00:58:58,745
I'll emphasize that that is very important.

1241
00:58:59,172 --> 00:59:01,011
The total proportion of this head,

1242
00:59:01,924 --> 00:59:04,691
even the outer line of the face,

1243
00:59:05,096 --> 00:59:06,870
that was a way to draw it precisely.

1244
00:59:07,128 --> 00:59:09,167
To make the face look pretty,

1245
00:59:09,192 --> 00:59:10,299
the amount of expression,

1246
00:59:10,324 --> 00:59:12,618
I told you that you need to be able to control it.

1247
00:59:13,421 --> 00:59:14,609
When you want to give a cute impression

1248
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:16,267
to a character,

1249
00:59:16,292 --> 00:59:18,066
don't depict it in detail as much.

1250
00:59:18,283 --> 00:59:20,500
Distribute things here and there.

1251
00:59:20,667 --> 00:59:22,183
Spread it out.

1252
00:59:22,357 --> 00:59:24,027
When you want to make it look pretty,

1253
00:59:24,106 --> 00:59:25,930
try to focus on the depiction much more.

1254
00:59:26,152 --> 00:59:28,714
So put it in a small section.

1255
00:59:28,917 --> 00:59:30,509
Using these two methods,

1256
00:59:30,511 --> 00:59:33,863
You can show your character in different ways.

1257
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:35,805
Using those things,

1258
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:37,542
try to draw a variety of faces.

1259
00:59:37,567 --> 00:59:40,135
As expected, you have to turn it around

1260
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,488
and look at it from various angles.

1261
00:59:43,917 --> 00:59:45,625
From the previous class,

1262
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:48,691
we were able to draw a simple human body.

1263
00:59:48,730 --> 00:59:51,424
And we were able to move that body.

1264
00:59:51,474 --> 00:59:53,620
We can attach it to a face now.

1265
00:59:54,081 --> 00:59:56,287
Although, having said this,

1266
00:59:56,312 --> 00:59:57,448
right after taking a class now,

1267
00:59:57,473 --> 01:00:00,378
I don't think you could draw it exactly like I have done.

1268
01:00:00,613 --> 01:00:03,840
As expected, for the drawing part, you'll need to continue to draw.

1269
01:00:03,842 --> 01:00:05,058
That's how you improve.

1270
01:00:05,214 --> 01:00:07,164
But for now, when it comes to how to improve,

1271
01:00:07,188 --> 01:00:08,738
I think I said enough.

1272
01:00:08,902 --> 01:00:11,441
I recommend you to keep on practicing those parts.

1273
01:00:11,558 --> 01:00:14,456
I think you can improve your skills from now on.

1274
01:00:14,458 --> 01:00:15,589
In the next class,

1275
01:00:15,614 --> 01:00:19,089
along with the hair that we didn't talk about in detail today,

1276
01:00:19,114 --> 01:00:20,745
I'm going to dress up the character.

1277
01:00:20,888 --> 01:00:23,635
We drew the human body of the character,

1278
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:25,666
and moved and drew the hair.

1279
01:00:25,691 --> 01:00:27,375
If you can dress it up,

1280
01:00:27,377 --> 01:00:28,617
literally and theoretically,

1281
01:00:28,641 --> 01:00:30,142
you will be able to draw a character.

1282
01:00:30,394 --> 01:00:32,652
So, while drawing those parts,

1283
01:00:32,677 --> 01:00:35,063
for the demonstration part that I was lacking earlier,

1284
01:00:35,065 --> 01:00:36,898
I'll try to fill it in then.

1285
01:00:37,407 --> 01:00:40,616
See you in the next class.

1286
01:00:40,641 --> 01:00:42,539
That's a wrap for today.

1287
01:00:42,629 --> 01:00:44,171
Thank you for your efforts.
