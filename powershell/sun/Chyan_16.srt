00:00:06,069 --> 00:00:07,104
Hello.

3
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:09,798
Last time, we worked on a full illustration.

4
00:00:09,823 --> 00:00:13,011
I'm going to work on a portrait illustration today.

5
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,747
We're going to make a design

6
00:00:15,772 --> 00:00:18,890
that is used for mobile games,

7
00:00:18,915 --> 00:00:21,251
for instance, 'gacha' games.

8
00:00:21,253 --> 00:00:25,201
I'm going to make a character design or illustration that would come out in a game.

9
00:00:25,203 --> 00:00:27,777
We're going to find out how to express it.

10
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,667
I used to call it portrait illustration.

11
00:00:30,692 --> 00:00:33,943
The name itself is kind of vague.

12
00:00:34,091 --> 00:00:36,751
Some people call it an in-game illustration.

13
00:00:36,753 --> 00:00:39,183
There are people who call it character illustration.

14
00:00:39,185 --> 00:00:41,096
There are a lot of terms,

15
00:00:41,098 --> 00:00:43,281
but what they have in common is that the background is transparent.

16
00:00:43,306 --> 00:00:45,572
So, there's only the character.

17
00:00:45,597 --> 00:00:47,317
I think it's that kind of illustration.

18
00:00:47,342 --> 00:00:50,324
Illustration with a transparent background and a single character.

19
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:52,310
That's how it usually goes.

20
00:00:52,312 --> 00:00:54,438
These days,

21
00:00:54,463 --> 00:00:57,536
as the scale of the mobile game industry grows,

22
00:00:57,561 --> 00:01:00,700
there's a slight change in things like that. They are changing little by little.

23
00:01:00,909 --> 00:01:03,093
There are times when we use a background,

24
00:01:03,284 --> 00:01:05,713
there are times when a lot of objects are put in.

25
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,990
Or it's not focusing on the character, but the background.

26
00:01:09,015 --> 00:01:11,155
Other times, it looks like a portrait illustration.

27
00:01:11,574 --> 00:01:13,091
There are a lot of differentials like that.

28
00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:16,915
This has increased the freedom of directing,

29
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,008
but also, the difficulty of the work itself is going up a lot.

30
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:21,313
That would be the downside.

31
00:01:21,626 --> 00:01:24,695
So when I worked on portrait illustrations before,

32
00:01:24,696 --> 00:01:27,940
even if you could just do a single illustration with only one character,

33
00:01:27,965 --> 00:01:31,726
you could commercialize it.

34
00:01:31,751 --> 00:01:33,754
It was like that.

35
00:01:33,779 --> 00:01:37,829
But recently, to draw in-game illustrations,

36
00:01:37,854 --> 00:01:40,290
you need to be able draw your own backgrounds.

37
00:01:40,315 --> 00:01:43,433
You have to be able to describe things to a certain extent.

38
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:45,686
So only people who can do that

39
00:01:45,711 --> 00:01:46,943
will be hired.

40
00:01:48,146 --> 00:01:49,851
With this portrait illustration,

41
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:53,826
there is a slight difference from the previous full illustration.

42
00:01:53,851 --> 00:01:55,125
Of course,

43
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,835
I said that

44
00:01:57,846 --> 00:01:58,849
there are times when the background is included in the illustrations.

45
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:01,276
The difference is that in the case of portrait illustrations,

46
00:02:01,301 --> 00:02:03,552
the shape itself is not square most of the time.

47
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,746
What does it look like?

48
00:02:05,771 --> 00:02:08,569
It literally follows the silhouette of the character.

49
00:02:08,594 --> 00:02:10,866
The background became transparent,

50
00:02:10,891 --> 00:02:13,698
and there are various interfaces that fit the game.

51
00:02:14,027 --> 00:02:17,141
The interface is open and a character is standing.

52
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:18,474
That's what it feels like.

53
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:23,166
So, when we made the full illustration,

54
00:02:23,183 --> 00:02:26,411
we focused on organizing the screen itself.

55
00:02:26,573 --> 00:02:30,491
So if the character is standing and the background is in the back,

56
00:02:30,516 --> 00:02:34,912
we paid attention to the character and the view from the background.

57
00:02:34,937 --> 00:02:37,688
The eyes that go out of the screen come back.

58
00:02:37,713 --> 00:02:39,658
We also paid attention to these things.

59
00:02:39,683 --> 00:02:42,231
But in portrait illustration,

60
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:43,884
the gaze doesn't go outside.

61
00:02:43,886 --> 00:02:48,143
The character is always at the center.

62
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:56,289
So when it comes to composing the screen,

63
00:02:56,314 --> 00:02:59,469
there will be some restrictions.

64
00:03:00,567 --> 00:03:02,532
You need to know them well when you're signing your contract.

65
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:05,630
I think it's better to calculate those things before going in.

66
00:03:05,655 --> 00:03:07,682
The difference is the difference...

67
00:03:07,684 --> 00:03:09,309
Usually, there may be restrictions...

68
00:03:09,334 --> 00:03:11,928
If I point out a few things that happen often...

69
00:03:11,953 --> 00:03:13,642
The first one is lighting.

70
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:19,544
Illustrations with a background can be centered on the background.

71
00:03:20,974 --> 00:03:23,525
The background can be the main focus, not the character.

72
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,511
Even if you use lighting that doesn't show your character well,

73
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,341
as long as the atmosphere is right,

74
00:03:27,366 --> 00:03:29,387
this can be a mood on its own.

75
00:03:29,412 --> 00:03:32,636
For the portrait illustration that goes for each character,

76
00:03:33,398 --> 00:03:36,688
the thing you need to ask yourself is,

77
00:03:36,713 --> 00:03:38,957
what does the character look like

78
00:03:38,982 --> 00:03:41,974
and what makes that character attractive?

79
00:03:41,976 --> 00:03:44,355
You need to focus your attention on the character.

80
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:47,438
Because of that, lighting that doesn't pay attention to the character

81
00:03:47,463 --> 00:03:49,219
can be hard to use.

82
00:03:49,484 --> 00:03:52,236
That's why there's a limit to the lighting.

83
00:03:53,792 --> 00:03:56,714
And when it comes to using the background,

84
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,164
except for the ones that you can use,

85
00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:03,638
except for games and companies that you can use them for,

86
00:04:03,663 --> 00:04:07,326
most of the time, it's hard to use the background.

87
00:04:07,486 --> 00:04:09,655
So, what happens if you can't use the background?

88
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,041
To make the surroundings of the character look fancy,

89
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:19,803
we can put in objects

90
00:04:20,107 --> 00:04:21,403
that show the space.

91
00:04:22,405 --> 00:04:26,643
You need to arrange the background and items.

92
00:04:28,812 --> 00:04:31,732
I controlled my character and background.

93
00:04:31,757 --> 00:04:33,576
With density distribution and things like that.

94
00:04:33,682 --> 00:04:36,511
Since I have to focus on the inside of my character,

95
00:04:36,892 --> 00:04:39,045
the need for description goes up.

96
00:04:40,089 --> 00:04:42,534
It's about what you can show inside your character.

97
00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:43,674
You need to have a lot of elements.

98
00:04:43,991 --> 00:04:47,749
If I want to show you a lot, I have to describe a lot.

99
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:51,316
You'll need details about the design or something like that.

100
00:04:51,318 --> 00:04:54,413
Because of that, there could be a difference in the amount of description you use.

101
00:04:58,001 --> 00:05:01,881
And you said you'd show the space with the characters, right?

102
00:05:01,906 --> 00:05:04,748
When it comes to expressing things like this, the three-dimensional effect...

103
00:05:06,466 --> 00:05:09,450
I think it's a bit more important.

104
00:05:09,788 --> 00:05:10,947
It's also a part of it...

105
00:05:13,081 --> 00:05:15,275
In the background,

106
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,427
there are times when you intentionally make it flat.

107
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,652
The background and characters are kind of flat.

108
00:05:22,772 --> 00:05:24,256
Like an Egyptian mural.

109
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:26,965
The flatness itself is a kind of art.

110
00:05:26,967 --> 00:05:29,477
It exists when you organize it, but in the illustration...

111
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:32,891
But in portrait illustrations, like the one here.

112
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,035
In other words, it could be too bold to use that kind of direction.

113
00:05:36,173 --> 00:05:38,708
For in-game character illustrations.

114
00:05:38,733 --> 00:05:41,833
So at times like this, for the three-dimensional effect of the character...

115
00:05:41,858 --> 00:05:43,640
You need to pay a lot of attention.

116
00:05:46,011 --> 00:05:49,148
To learn these things today,

117
00:05:49,173 --> 00:05:52,317
I'm going to use the characters that I designed before.

118
00:05:52,342 --> 00:05:56,413
I'm going to mix the elements that the character can use.

119
00:05:56,415 --> 00:05:58,324
I'm going to draw attention

120
00:05:58,326 --> 00:06:02,147
with all the silhouettes and eyes that we learned earlier.

121
00:06:02,149 --> 00:06:05,561
We're going to make a portrait illustration thumbnail for the character.

122
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:07,644
Let's move on.

123
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:11,724
Before we go in,

124
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:14,204
let's see how the character should stand.

125
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:15,665
I'm going to think about it.

126
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,643
Before that, we need to think about...

127
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,811
This is the same as full illustration.

128
00:06:19,836 --> 00:06:22,835
Whatever illustration we draw, the first thing we have to think about is

129
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,819
what you want to show in this character.

130
00:06:26,127 --> 00:06:28,840
Which part do you want to show the most to the viewers?

131
00:06:28,865 --> 00:06:31,032
What kind of mood do you want to show?

132
00:06:31,108 --> 00:06:33,179
I want to express this...

133
00:06:33,204 --> 00:06:35,134
That's what it's all about.

134
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,248
It's very important.

135
00:06:36,715 --> 00:06:40,298
As expected, the character's face and teeth...

136
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:43,263
I hope this part can be highlighted.

137
00:06:43,288 --> 00:06:45,205
Same as the full illustration.

138
00:06:45,344 --> 00:06:46,824
But the difference is,

139
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:49,916
in this illustration, I want to show the wand.

140
00:06:50,102 --> 00:06:51,812
When I worked on the full illustration,

141
00:06:51,837 --> 00:06:54,309
the wand was missing from the elements.

142
00:06:55,587 --> 00:06:58,758
So, I'll put the wand inside the screen.

143
00:06:58,783 --> 00:07:00,297
I wish I could show you.

144
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:02,862
In other words, the theme part is the face of the character.

145
00:07:03,814 --> 00:07:06,595
The wand would be the sub element.

146
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,760
And then the sub element...

147
00:07:08,785 --> 00:07:10,890
I think it'll be the creature in the back.

148
00:07:11,518 --> 00:07:14,721
Let's think about how to organize it.

149
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:19,483
I can use the characters and the things in the back.

150
00:07:19,508 --> 00:07:22,475
I said that the character needs to be more focused.

151
00:07:22,518 --> 00:07:25,640
To give a strong impression to the character,

152
00:07:25,665 --> 00:07:27,983
we have to think a lot about it.

153
00:07:28,503 --> 00:07:30,149
The first thing I'm going to use is...

154
00:07:31,112 --> 00:07:33,210
Just like the full illustration,

155
00:07:36,029 --> 00:07:38,844
you can see through the character's face.

156
00:07:45,352 --> 00:07:47,276
The face is kind of at a low angle.

157
00:07:47,435 --> 00:07:49,220
The upper body is kind of at a high angle.

158
00:07:50,808 --> 00:07:52,157
It's going to go in...

159
00:07:56,294 --> 00:07:59,334
The lower the angle, the higher the angle.

160
00:08:07,076 --> 00:08:09,902
I'm going to express the space where this character is standing.

161
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,663
Usually, when I work with portrait illustration,

162
00:08:12,688 --> 00:08:15,746
even if it's see-through, it's like drawing an illustration with a background.

163
00:08:15,771 --> 00:08:18,699
There are many times when I can't put in a lot of perspective.

164
00:08:18,724 --> 00:08:19,974
If you apply too much perspective,

165
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,198
you can't really see the character's design.

166
00:08:25,261 --> 00:08:27,108
There are restrictions on things like that.

167
00:08:27,133 --> 00:08:29,631
In general, the height of your gaze...

168
00:08:29,656 --> 00:08:32,407
Unless there's a low angle or something like that,

169
00:08:32,432 --> 00:08:36,553
it's around the shoulder, around here.

170
00:08:36,971 --> 00:08:39,311
So, as you go down,

171
00:08:39,313 --> 00:08:41,287
the angle is getting higher.

172
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:44,475
On the floor, the space was spread out like this...

173
00:08:45,998 --> 00:08:47,905
The space where this character is standing...

174
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:50,049
It's important to keep guessing

175
00:08:54,187 --> 00:08:55,820
so that it looks more dimensional.

176
00:08:56,404 --> 00:08:58,238
I can show you my character.

177
00:09:14,885 --> 00:09:17,031
To show you the wand,

178
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,516
put the wand at the front of the screen.

179
00:09:20,211 --> 00:09:21,864
I think that would be nice.

180
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:24,591
It's too much if I push it forward.

181
00:09:25,082 --> 00:09:27,023
There are a lot of things to express in this drawing, right?

182
00:09:27,048 --> 00:09:29,741
If there's only a character and a wand,

183
00:09:30,993 --> 00:09:32,399
stretch its arms forward.

184
00:09:32,424 --> 00:09:35,018
I don't mind if the wand is shown.

185
00:09:35,043 --> 00:09:36,086
Besides that,

186
00:09:36,088 --> 00:09:38,119
I need to put it to the creature in the back, too.

187
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:41,322
I don't think it's good if the wand draws too much attention.

188
00:09:42,712 --> 00:09:43,885
To do that,

189
00:09:47,206 --> 00:09:48,519
the wand should be kind of off to the side.

190
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:53,210
You can show your character's individuality through hand gestures.

191
00:10:07,601 --> 00:10:11,018
The angle of the wand is tilted like this.

192
00:10:11,059 --> 00:10:13,200
To cut off the body of the character...

193
00:10:13,467 --> 00:10:16,257
So, the view from the top to the bottom...

194
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,231
I twisted it into an S shape

195
00:10:18,632 --> 00:10:21,102
It's to make the character more assertive.

196
00:10:21,127 --> 00:10:23,111
For a situation where the character is more assertive...

197
00:10:23,136 --> 00:10:26,209
So I cut it off and made it more assertive.

198
00:10:26,455 --> 00:10:28,808
When I talked about what I saw before,

199
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,181
that was the part I focused on.

200
00:10:30,183 --> 00:10:33,596
If this wand goes along with the character,

201
00:10:33,598 --> 00:10:36,267
it's easy to focus on the overall situation,

202
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:39,272
but it's hard to concentrate.

203
00:10:39,274 --> 00:10:42,797
So that you can cross the character's body with this wand,

204
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:45,549
I'll set it up and show you those parts

205
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,073
in a powerful way.

206
00:10:48,074 --> 00:10:49,372
Let's do that.

207
00:11:00,384 --> 00:11:02,163
While adjusting the angle,

208
00:11:03,365 --> 00:11:05,638
let's find the feeling we want

209
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,200
for the thumbnail sketch.

210
00:11:15,227 --> 00:11:17,612
It's not like drawing the human body.

211
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,225
We need to get on with comprising the overall mood.

212
00:11:35,689 --> 00:11:37,593
I'll make the face look more detailed.

213
00:11:37,954 --> 00:11:39,309
I'll express it.

214
00:11:52,465 --> 00:11:54,445
The overall silhouette...

215
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:57,476
I'm going to make a diamond shape.

216
00:11:59,816 --> 00:12:03,372
I think it's because we want to stimulate the desire to buy.

217
00:12:03,592 --> 00:12:05,532
Because of the nature of portrait illustration,

218
00:12:05,557 --> 00:12:07,631
if I see some characters, I want to pick one.

219
00:12:07,656 --> 00:12:09,424
You have to feel that way.

220
00:12:09,449 --> 00:12:11,933
The overall fanciness of the character is...

221
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:14,462
There are a lot of times when it goes into the basics.

222
00:12:16,071 --> 00:12:19,221
I sometimes break things like this when I draw a character in that level.

223
00:12:19,246 --> 00:12:21,519
Like a level 2 or level 3 character.

224
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,998
The extra characters in the game.

225
00:12:24,023 --> 00:12:26,828
I need to hold it in when I draw things like that.

226
00:12:27,638 --> 00:12:29,355
In most cases, for outsourcing works,

227
00:12:29,357 --> 00:12:31,318
I work on a lot of level 5 characters.

228
00:12:31,477 --> 00:12:32,595
When that happens,

229
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,302
to make the character look fancy,

230
00:12:35,327 --> 00:12:37,841
it's very important to compose it well.

231
00:12:38,393 --> 00:12:40,410
You can use it effectively at times like that.

232
00:12:40,435 --> 00:12:41,416
It's a silhouette.

233
00:12:41,441 --> 00:12:44,149
From the silhouette, the diamond-shaped silhouette...

234
00:12:44,595 --> 00:12:46,895
It's effective in showing off your character.

235
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,315
I would have said that.

236
00:12:49,806 --> 00:12:51,905
At the bottom,

237
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,637
I'm going to put many elements in.

238
00:12:54,514 --> 00:12:56,621
The reason why I put a lot at the bottom is because

239
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,544
of the nature of the portrait illustration that requires space to be visible.

240
00:13:02,578 --> 00:13:04,088
If many of the top elements are placed,

241
00:13:04,113 --> 00:13:06,028
it's good to have cute characters,

242
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:09,103
but it's hard to show that kind of space.

243
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:14,695
When you make the background surrounding the character,

244
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,244
if the background goes to the back of the head,

245
00:13:17,571 --> 00:13:19,721
it's hard to focus on the face.

246
00:13:19,957 --> 00:13:22,705
So I'm going to place a lot of elements at the bottom.

247
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:25,232
It's about increasing stability.

248
00:13:25,288 --> 00:13:27,712
So when I was working on portrait illustration,

249
00:13:27,737 --> 00:13:32,629
I put a lot of elements on the bottom.

250
00:13:34,184 --> 00:13:36,388
It's my personal style.

251
00:13:36,688 --> 00:13:38,868
It's not that I can't use the inverted triangle silhouette.

252
00:13:38,893 --> 00:13:40,540
There are times when I use it, too

253
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:43,512
The character is really cheerful

254
00:13:43,537 --> 00:13:46,613
And if need to show that kind of action

255
00:13:46,638 --> 00:13:49,301
I use an inverted triangle.

256
00:13:49,326 --> 00:13:53,624
In general, it means to follow the triangle a little bit more.

257
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,054
With a diamond shape as the base,

258
00:13:57,089 --> 00:13:59,115
mix the triangle a little bit.

259
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,439
It's good to go in.

260
00:14:06,984 --> 00:14:09,531
If you have a certain frame of character...

261
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,145
Let's make it smaller.

262
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,334
I haven't added a triangular silhouette yet.

263
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,221
I put its hair up

264
00:14:21,246 --> 00:14:24,123
We said we were going to add the triangular silhouette but it didn't go in.

265
00:14:24,148 --> 00:14:28,122
I'm going to put those parts in there.

266
00:14:29,906 --> 00:14:31,395
To the bottom of the face,

267
00:14:31,723 --> 00:14:34,110
I want to give a strong impression.

268
00:14:34,976 --> 00:14:36,932
As I want to give it a strong image,

269
00:14:36,957 --> 00:14:40,316
I'm going to add some action to the creature in the back.

270
00:14:40,494 --> 00:14:42,899
When we make up our characters' moves,

271
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:45,219
if there's a story behind them,

272
00:14:45,244 --> 00:14:48,158
I think it can have with a stronger vibe.

273
00:14:48,183 --> 00:14:50,266
For example, sitting down

274
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:53,288
versus sitting down and putting a hand forward.

275
00:14:53,313 --> 00:14:54,671
If that happens,

276
00:14:54,696 --> 00:14:56,416
the side that you put out your hand while sitting down...

277
00:14:56,441 --> 00:14:59,231
It's a concept that makes it look more dynamic.

278
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,558
That's why the creature over here stays still

279
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:05,973
rather than not staying still. He's opening his mouth.

280
00:15:05,998 --> 00:15:08,268
If you add a simple action like this,

281
00:15:08,293 --> 00:15:10,943
it's more dynamic.

282
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:15,956
Open the mouth here.

283
00:15:17,385 --> 00:15:20,220
Like moving your character's legs with the tentacles.

284
00:15:23,696 --> 00:15:26,922
It's very effective to show the space.

285
00:15:26,947 --> 00:15:29,970
I think it's a good item to do that.

286
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,919
The tentacles... The floor perspective that we're going to show you.

287
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,119
I'll show you this one indirectly.

288
00:15:38,497 --> 00:15:40,024
I'll have to shrink it a little bit more.

289
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,516
The wider you do the silhouette...

290
00:16:03,677 --> 00:16:05,706
As the scale of the picture gets bigger,

291
00:16:06,018 --> 00:16:09,901
If you look at the weaknesses, you focus on the character itself.

292
00:16:09,912 --> 00:16:11,565
So, looking at the character's face,

293
00:16:11,575 --> 00:16:13,458
it's going to be a bit more difficult.

294
00:16:13,483 --> 00:16:15,386
The character was made to look fancy.

295
00:16:15,411 --> 00:16:17,037
It's very effective.

296
00:16:17,392 --> 00:16:20,081
So, when there's an in-game illustration,

297
00:16:20,106 --> 00:16:23,643
when it comes to the primary awakening, you can see it on the left side of the screen.

298
00:16:24,476 --> 00:16:26,729
There's more composition where it stands still.

299
00:16:26,754 --> 00:16:30,520
And then you need it to go in a fancier way with the second awakening.

300
00:16:30,605 --> 00:16:32,288
You know, things like elite knights, right?

301
00:16:32,313 --> 00:16:34,250
Most of the time,

302
00:16:34,275 --> 00:16:36,380
if the scale grows horizontally and goes in...

303
00:16:36,405 --> 00:16:37,654
I'm sure you've seen it a lot.

304
00:16:47,472 --> 00:16:50,462
Wrap the tentacles in the back like this.

305
00:16:51,172 --> 00:16:53,484
I'll use the 8-shaped composition, too.

306
00:16:56,378 --> 00:16:58,721
I told you this when I was looking at it and making a silhouette.

307
00:16:58,746 --> 00:17:01,914
You can mix these silhouettes.

308
00:17:02,371 --> 00:17:03,876
This is a diamond silhouette.

309
00:17:03,901 --> 00:17:07,202
Triangular, 8-shaped, etc. They will be mixed together.

310
00:17:37,709 --> 00:17:40,052
Adjust the ambiguous angles...

311
00:17:48,093 --> 00:17:49,422
Place it like this.

312
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:52,168
At this point, we're going to start the second sketch.

313
00:17:52,193 --> 00:17:54,104
In the process of starting the second sketch,

314
00:17:54,129 --> 00:17:55,936
continue to give yourself self-feedback.

315
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,868
I'm not sure if the things I wanted to express went well.

316
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:00,862
Let's check before we go in.

317
00:18:01,591 --> 00:18:03,380
The face of the character,

318
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:04,774
the upper part of the chest.

319
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,564
Can you concentrate on them now?

320
00:18:07,589 --> 00:18:10,535
Low, middle, and high angles were expressed.

321
00:18:10,537 --> 00:18:15,224
Since the tentacles are in this area,

322
00:18:15,226 --> 00:18:16,810
I think the character's face can

323
00:18:16,812 --> 00:18:19,946
definitely be part of the main element.

324
00:18:19,971 --> 00:18:21,028
And next...

325
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:23,656
Thanks to the wand that's sticking out,

326
00:18:23,681 --> 00:18:26,601
the design of this wand will be visible.

327
00:18:26,792 --> 00:18:28,945
And then if you look down,

328
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:29,972
you can see the visible tentacles.

329
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:33,601
You can see that the order that I first came up with was reflected.

330
00:18:37,611 --> 00:18:39,430
Through self-feedback,

331
00:18:39,455 --> 00:18:41,049
you can move on to the 2nd sketch.

332
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:04,415
Usually, in real life, there are thumbnail sketches, too.

333
00:19:04,417 --> 00:19:09,227
I think it's better to make 2 or 3 general proposals and send them to the company.

334
00:19:09,252 --> 00:19:10,700
It's usually a polite gesture.

335
00:19:10,725 --> 00:19:13,936
It's kind of like a promise.

336
00:19:13,961 --> 00:19:15,945
I'll send you 3 drafts.

337
00:19:16,417 --> 00:19:18,937
There are a lot of times when I write it down on a contract.

338
00:19:20,287 --> 00:19:21,837
So whenever you have time,

339
00:19:21,862 --> 00:19:24,787
I think it's better to practice by picking a lot of rough sketches.

340
00:19:24,812 --> 00:19:26,844
It will help you a lot later on.

341
00:19:29,219 --> 00:19:32,118
For those who want to draw in-game illustrations,

342
00:19:32,143 --> 00:19:36,912
if you have a particular game that you like,

343
00:19:37,289 --> 00:19:40,763
and if you want to draw in-game illustrations,

344
00:19:40,788 --> 00:19:42,502
make sure to design your own characters.

345
00:19:42,527 --> 00:19:43,933
With each character,

346
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:46,028
draw the first and second awakenings separately.

347
00:19:46,053 --> 00:19:48,019
That's what I recommend.

348
00:19:48,374 --> 00:19:49,575
The reason why I do that is because,

349
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,510
when we draw character illustrations,

350
00:19:52,535 --> 00:19:55,151
there are a lot of normal standing illustrations,

351
00:19:55,176 --> 00:19:56,712
like the one on the left.

352
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,532
Otherwise, there are background scenes.

353
00:19:59,557 --> 00:20:01,572
It's easy, but relatively,

354
00:20:03,431 --> 00:20:05,547
if I try to come up with an illustration that fits 'in-game',

355
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:07,499
the scale doesn't get bigger.

356
00:20:07,501 --> 00:20:11,973
So, I'm going to work on it briefly.

357
00:20:11,984 --> 00:20:12,985
Like the one on the left.

358
00:20:13,581 --> 00:20:17,546
And develop that character from there.

359
00:20:17,557 --> 00:20:18,819
Let's do it.

360
00:20:19,105 --> 00:20:21,361
Let's say the first round was the first one I did.

361
00:20:21,363 --> 00:20:25,089
If you see it as an awakened character,

362
00:20:25,114 --> 00:20:27,271
how can you make it fancy?

363
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,553
In the process of composing it,

364
00:20:29,564 --> 00:20:31,771
the gaze that we learned earlier, or

365
00:20:31,796 --> 00:20:35,333
the silhouette, lighting, and that kind of information,

366
00:20:35,358 --> 00:20:36,868
you should be putting everything in,

367
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:40,894
while constantly organizing the screen

368
00:20:44,348 --> 00:20:47,287
to make room for the characters.

369
00:20:51,182 --> 00:20:53,203
In the process, you'll continue to develop your senses

370
00:20:53,228 --> 00:20:55,518
to be able to work right away.

371
00:20:55,742 --> 00:20:57,709
I think that's the ideal picture.

372
00:20:58,191 --> 00:21:01,702
So if you want to draw a game character,

373
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:04,259
if you want to try a game illustration,

374
00:21:04,284 --> 00:21:07,854
I hope you practice making illustrations like this later on.

375
00:21:07,865 --> 00:21:08,817
I certainly recommend it.

376
00:21:09,793 --> 00:21:12,316
But even when you hear this,

377
00:21:12,341 --> 00:21:14,102
you know what I want to direct.

378
00:21:14,127 --> 00:21:15,871
And you know what I want to express.

379
00:21:15,896 --> 00:21:17,966
You want to show off these parts,

380
00:21:17,991 --> 00:21:20,625
but you won't know what position the character should take to express that.

381
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:23,100
If you can't get the hang of it even when you watch this video...

382
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:26,134
Actually, the answer to that was in the beginning.

383
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,236
You'd use references.

384
00:21:29,897 --> 00:21:31,662
For example, what I wanted to show you,

385
00:21:31,687 --> 00:21:33,344
it was the side of the character.

386
00:21:33,602 --> 00:21:36,507
I think the design of that area is fun.

387
00:21:36,532 --> 00:21:39,023
So I want to show off the design of the sides.

388
00:21:39,024 --> 00:21:42,462
Keep looking for an illustration that highlights the sides.

389
00:21:42,828 --> 00:21:45,072
You can refer to that as your 'friend'.

390
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,565
What I wanted to show was the leg line.

391
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,749
Let's find an illustration that highlights the leg line.

392
00:21:50,774 --> 00:21:52,554
Just keep that in mind.

393
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:53,886
I'll do my best.

394
00:21:54,687 --> 00:21:58,040
I told you everything about the screen

395
00:21:58,065 --> 00:21:59,862
in this curriculum,

396
00:21:59,872 --> 00:22:01,596
so it might not be included.

397
00:22:01,621 --> 00:22:02,640
This happens because,

398
00:22:02,665 --> 00:22:05,657
in the end, the things you learn only from experience...

399
00:22:05,668 --> 00:22:07,382
There are a lot of them.

400
00:22:07,407 --> 00:22:10,063
I can't make up those experiences for you.

401
00:22:10,244 --> 00:22:13,630
Instead, I told you about the factors that can fill in that experience.

402
00:22:13,655 --> 00:22:15,183
Experience can be filled in.

403
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,583
In other words, the only thing that can fill your muscle memory is

404
00:22:18,093 --> 00:22:19,298
to use your brain.

405
00:22:20,782 --> 00:22:23,211
The things you can't do with your brain,

406
00:22:23,236 --> 00:22:26,044
you can use materials for as indirect experience.

407
00:22:26,069 --> 00:22:28,273
That is also about using your head.

408
00:22:29,869 --> 00:22:32,615
They're tools that support your head.

409
00:22:34,607 --> 00:22:37,745
If you approach illustrations that way...

410
00:22:37,922 --> 00:22:40,672
Of course, compared to those who draw with their gut feelings,

411
00:22:40,697 --> 00:22:42,223
it might take some time.

412
00:22:43,066 --> 00:22:46,002
Compared to people who just know things at first glance,

413
00:22:46,027 --> 00:22:48,133
it might take some time,

414
00:22:49,711 --> 00:22:51,196
but when you invest that time,

415
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,778
if you had set a goal and carried it out alright... you can do it.

416
00:22:54,608 --> 00:22:57,416
So, you're not wrong about what you're thinking,

417
00:22:57,441 --> 00:22:59,898
it'll definitely take some time,

418
00:22:59,923 --> 00:23:02,495
but you'll eventually be able to reach a positive result.

419
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,095
Now, I repeat that

420
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,692
making it your own...

421
00:23:09,092 --> 00:23:11,715
I think that's the best way to study.

422
00:23:15,318 --> 00:23:18,227
Should people who just started drawing not be able to draw well?

423
00:23:18,683 --> 00:23:22,372
I want to say that it's not true.

424
00:23:22,811 --> 00:23:25,242
Even for those who don't have much experience,

425
00:23:25,267 --> 00:23:26,732
depending on the person,

426
00:23:26,757 --> 00:23:30,531
there are people who draw really well considering it's their first time.

427
00:23:30,891 --> 00:23:33,588
Most of those people are good at using references.

428
00:23:33,722 --> 00:23:35,235
They're good at using references,

429
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:38,272
and they know exactly what they want to show.

430
00:23:38,968 --> 00:23:41,552
If the illustration doesn't come out well compared to the time you spent on it,

431
00:23:41,577 --> 00:23:42,862
it's because you're not sure

432
00:23:42,887 --> 00:23:44,621
what you want to express.

433
00:23:45,764 --> 00:23:48,660
So, I want to make those parts clear.

434
00:23:49,618 --> 00:23:51,032
When you are doing the illustration,

435
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:54,247
when you do the portrait illustration, or the full illustration,

436
00:23:54,272 --> 00:23:55,488
be clear about it.

437
00:23:55,513 --> 00:23:57,793
And use the things

438
00:23:57,818 --> 00:23:58,832
you can use for each situation.

439
00:23:58,857 --> 00:24:01,927
If there's something you can't use, you can fill it in with something else.

440
00:24:01,952 --> 00:24:05,526
So, in this curriculum,

441
00:24:06,498 --> 00:24:09,494
I keep telling you

442
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:11,335
about the elements that are good to use.

443
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,168
In other words, the elements that we can use and cannot use.

444
00:24:13,473 --> 00:24:16,056
If you learn those things well,

445
00:24:16,468 --> 00:24:18,523
you can use that as a weapon.

446
00:24:19,661 --> 00:24:21,929
That's what I want to emphasize.

447
00:24:21,954 --> 00:24:24,197
I'm doing the 2nd sketch now.

448
00:24:26,897 --> 00:24:28,279
The skirt got a bit bigger.

449
00:24:28,752 --> 00:24:30,612
I'll shrink it a bit.

450
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,778
I'll show the design of the legs.

451
00:24:58,357 --> 00:25:00,518
If I show the tentacles,

452
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:01,484
what do you think?

453
00:25:01,509 --> 00:25:04,743
Now, this is an illustration

454
00:25:04,745 --> 00:25:06,123
that could be used in-game to a certain extent.

455
00:25:06,895 --> 00:25:09,107
While maintaining a diamond silhouette,

456
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:10,709
There's a lot of triangle silhouettes mixed in.

457
00:25:10,734 --> 00:25:12,520
Using the 8-shaped composition,

458
00:25:12,545 --> 00:25:14,613
I focused on the character's face.

459
00:25:14,866 --> 00:25:16,766
In the order that I wanted to show you,

460
00:25:16,791 --> 00:25:21,140
the character, the wand, and the tentacles in the back,

461
00:25:21,165 --> 00:25:22,615
I showed them in order.

462
00:25:22,982 --> 00:25:25,883
As the canvas has gotten bigger,

463
00:25:25,908 --> 00:25:27,605
you can't really see its face.

464
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,622
So that you can see its face more,

465
00:25:29,624 --> 00:25:31,510
It's okay to increase the size here.

466
00:25:31,512 --> 00:25:33,537
I'll be applying deformers for the situation

467
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:35,381
as we learned about deformers.

468
00:25:37,233 --> 00:25:38,904
In full body illustrations,

469
00:25:38,905 --> 00:25:41,006
when you can't see the character's face because it's too small,

470
00:25:41,031 --> 00:25:43,635
I purposely made the character's face bigger

471
00:25:46,674 --> 00:25:48,731
and made the face visible somehow.

472
00:25:49,406 --> 00:25:51,589
Deformers can be used like this.

473
00:25:51,614 --> 00:25:53,122
Please remember this, too.

474
00:25:59,703 --> 00:26:01,454
Since we've done one composition,

475
00:26:01,464 --> 00:26:03,422
I should try something different.

476
00:26:04,036 --> 00:26:05,432
Secondly,

477
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,508
the character's posture.

478
00:26:11,533 --> 00:26:13,242
It's pretty strong.

479
00:26:13,267 --> 00:26:16,533
The creature in the back will assist the character.

480
00:26:16,535 --> 00:26:18,604
That's how it's composed.

481
00:26:18,629 --> 00:26:19,894
The second thing I'm going to do is

482
00:26:19,929 --> 00:26:22,754
make the character stand still.

483
00:26:22,779 --> 00:26:25,513
Let's move the creature in the back dynamically.

484
00:26:25,514 --> 00:26:27,810
Or we can link the background a bit.

485
00:26:27,812 --> 00:26:29,582
I'll try to increase the scale.

486
00:26:29,607 --> 00:26:32,017
As a result, it's like the seasoning of a dish.

487
00:26:32,019 --> 00:26:35,231
If you increase the charm of your character,

488
00:26:35,233 --> 00:26:37,246
it reduces the charm of the background.

489
00:26:37,566 --> 00:26:39,179
If you take out the character's charm,

490
00:26:39,204 --> 00:26:40,385
the charm of the background increases.

491
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:41,737
That's the concept.

492
00:26:41,889 --> 00:26:44,131
However, the theme is character.

493
00:26:44,156 --> 00:26:46,819
It's just that the premise is not broken.

494
00:26:50,495 --> 00:26:52,561
Make it smaller and move it to the side.

495
00:26:55,499 --> 00:26:56,881
In the second composition,

496
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:59,059
the character will be calm.

497
00:27:01,188 --> 00:27:03,815
I'm going to keep the strong impression intact.

498
00:27:27,177 --> 00:27:28,813
To give a strong impression,

499
00:27:28,838 --> 00:27:31,929
use the hair to make it close to an inverted triangle silhouette.

500
00:27:32,353 --> 00:27:34,596
I'm going to widen the lower area.

501
00:27:36,482 --> 00:27:38,614
As expected, there's a creature in the bottom layer.

502
00:27:38,639 --> 00:27:40,694
So, I'm going to complete the triangular silhouette.

503
00:27:50,933 --> 00:27:53,521
I want to show my character's face strongly.

504
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:54,873
It's the same this time.

505
00:27:55,894 --> 00:27:57,219
The character's unique point is that...

506
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,477
I think it comes from the face.

507
00:28:00,368 --> 00:28:03,855
Then, this character is a character that doesn't show its face well.

508
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,165
That's okay if you say so.

509
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,800
You can emphasize other parts

510
00:28:06,825 --> 00:28:08,643
if you're not emphasizing the face.

511
00:28:08,668 --> 00:28:10,542
But I think 70 to 80 percent of the time you draw,

512
00:28:10,567 --> 00:28:12,281
the face is going to stand out first.

513
00:28:13,802 --> 00:28:15,024
There's nothing you can do.

514
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:17,006
Casual characters need to be pretty.

515
00:28:33,626 --> 00:28:34,729
As I always say,

516
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:38,380
for the thumbnail, you should focus on making it look nice.

517
00:28:41,472 --> 00:28:44,436
Let's do that later.

518
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:46,899
If you pay too much attention in the beginning,

519
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,502
as your working time gets longer,

520
00:28:48,511 --> 00:28:51,407
there are times when you can't express the feeling that you want.

521
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:12,319
It feels like the wand is crossed with the character.

522
00:29:12,344 --> 00:29:13,301
I'm going to put it in.

523
00:29:14,784 --> 00:29:16,226
I'll place it in the back like this.

524
00:29:16,251 --> 00:29:17,761
I'm going to hold it horizontally this way.

525
00:29:26,023 --> 00:29:27,827
If you cross it like this,

526
00:29:28,788 --> 00:29:30,927
as the character becomes a cross shape,

527
00:29:30,952 --> 00:29:33,118
the character in the middle section

528
00:29:33,143 --> 00:29:34,750
will attract a lot of attention.

529
00:29:39,785 --> 00:29:42,081
Since you're focused enough on your character,

530
00:29:42,106 --> 00:29:44,231
it's okay to make a fuss in the back.

531
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,296
Make a fuss with the creature in the back

532
00:29:49,321 --> 00:29:51,447
as if you've never seen such a thing before.

533
00:29:54,512 --> 00:29:57,442
When you don't draw much attention towards your character,

534
00:29:57,467 --> 00:29:59,139
if you do something like this,

535
00:29:59,164 --> 00:30:00,997
the creature can become the main element.

536
00:30:01,022 --> 00:30:02,733
It would be a very dangerous choice.

537
00:30:02,758 --> 00:30:05,451
But now we're crossing the wand.

538
00:30:05,453 --> 00:30:08,309
Unlike the background,

539
00:30:08,311 --> 00:30:09,748
I'll make it stand calmly,

540
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,783
or because it has this gap...

541
00:30:11,808 --> 00:30:13,146
In terms of the character, no matter what,

542
00:30:13,147 --> 00:30:15,326
it's a section that attracts people's attention.

543
00:30:15,351 --> 00:30:18,641
Since it's that kind of situation, I was able to direct it

544
00:30:19,193 --> 00:30:20,646
by making a fuss in the back.

545
00:30:20,671 --> 00:30:22,112
That's what you can think.

546
00:30:24,383 --> 00:30:26,890
The quiet character and its chaotic surroundings.

547
00:30:26,915 --> 00:30:28,620
There's a big difference between them.

548
00:30:28,645 --> 00:30:29,958
For that character,

549
00:30:29,983 --> 00:30:32,807
when you give it a scary feeling,

550
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:34,264
it's going to be effective.

551
00:30:34,714 --> 00:30:36,791
Should I say it's different?

552
00:30:42,093 --> 00:30:45,144
You can think of it as intentionally using unnaturalness.

553
00:30:45,738 --> 00:30:48,633
A simple theory of instilling fear.

554
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,417
In a way, it's not simple.

555
00:30:50,442 --> 00:30:51,957
It's an interesting theory.

556
00:30:51,982 --> 00:30:54,081
Out of that...

557
00:30:54,392 --> 00:30:56,636
There's a theory called the uncanny valley.

558
00:30:59,214 --> 00:31:02,802
The closer the character gets to reality, the more attractive it becomes

559
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,798
but there's a sudden drop in attractiveness at a certain level.

560
00:31:07,797 --> 00:31:10,439
The part where your attractiveness increases and then decreases.

561
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:13,291
When we saw this section, we called it an uncanny valley.

562
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:17,080
When we want to instill fear into our characters,

563
00:31:17,098 --> 00:31:19,011
when you want to give off a horror vibe...

564
00:31:19,036 --> 00:31:21,700
The point is to touch the valley on purpose.

565
00:31:21,725 --> 00:31:24,605
When you look at this picture, it needs to look unnatural.

566
00:31:25,234 --> 00:31:26,372
One of them...

567
00:31:26,397 --> 00:31:28,787
The background in chaos and the character who stays still.

568
00:31:28,812 --> 00:31:31,056
The unnaturalness that comes out between them,

569
00:31:31,081 --> 00:31:32,405
you would want to express that.

570
00:31:34,801 --> 00:31:36,855
I'm going to express fog in the back

571
00:31:38,281 --> 00:31:40,783
and make the silhouette as wide as possible.

572
00:31:44,326 --> 00:31:47,132
It can enhance the fear from the viewers.

573
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:00,440
The overall posture of the character has become very monotonous,

574
00:32:00,465 --> 00:32:02,831
but, let's make a flow here.

575
00:32:03,082 --> 00:32:06,012
When the posture is small, and if you want to make the flow clear,

576
00:32:06,611 --> 00:32:09,435
the end part of the gaze flow is important.

577
00:32:09,805 --> 00:32:10,925
What would be the end part?

578
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,778
There's not much you can control with the feet.

579
00:32:12,803 --> 00:32:15,905
The area that you can adjust the size of will be the face.

580
00:32:16,282 --> 00:32:20,242
So, the line that's like this...

581
00:32:22,293 --> 00:32:23,947
If there's a line like this,

582
00:32:24,486 --> 00:32:27,532
the middle part is definitely less bent, right?

583
00:32:27,557 --> 00:32:29,938
But since this area is bent a lot,

584
00:32:30,204 --> 00:32:31,497
from the perspective of the viewers,

585
00:32:31,528 --> 00:32:33,796
it looks more bent.

586
00:32:33,821 --> 00:32:36,070
Even though the end of this curve is bent.

587
00:32:39,274 --> 00:32:41,844
Then, the face of this character

588
00:32:45,779 --> 00:32:47,003
will be bent like this.

589
00:32:47,775 --> 00:32:51,280
Bend the shoulder so that it's opposite to your face.

590
00:32:54,795 --> 00:32:57,231
By creating the contrapposto to the human body,

591
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:10,435
you can strengthen the character's

592
00:33:10,436 --> 00:33:12,041
atmosphere overall.

593
00:33:18,895 --> 00:33:21,701
If you go into the second sketch,

594
00:34:03,273 --> 00:34:06,387
the skirt has a low angle.

595
00:34:08,411 --> 00:34:10,547
It feels like it is held up.

596
00:34:18,078 --> 00:34:20,987
Other than that, the place we look at the characters

597
00:34:21,012 --> 00:34:23,076
would mostly be the shoulder area.

598
00:34:23,093 --> 00:34:25,958
You saw the character at a low angle.

599
00:34:25,967 --> 00:34:26,981
If you give it that feeling,

600
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:29,510
the character itself looks huge.

601
00:34:29,937 --> 00:34:32,748
You can control the pressure that comes out of it.

602
00:34:33,391 --> 00:34:35,192
I think it's easy.

603
00:34:35,193 --> 00:34:37,276
When you look at the low angle and high angle,

604
00:34:37,277 --> 00:34:40,671
the low angle would be more intimidating.

605
00:34:41,568 --> 00:34:44,620
Usually, cute characters are looked up at from the bottom.

606
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:46,177
It's a bit of an overbearing character,

607
00:34:46,202 --> 00:34:49,283
like a queen.

608
00:34:49,308 --> 00:34:51,832
There are a lot of times when these characters look down on you.

609
00:34:54,898 --> 00:34:57,340
You can use those images, too.

610
00:34:57,911 --> 00:35:00,375
The images that we use in the picture.

611
00:35:00,376 --> 00:35:02,296
The image is...

612
00:35:03,481 --> 00:35:06,456
Even if I ask people who don't draw,

613
00:35:06,457 --> 00:35:08,218
Most of them say the same thing.

614
00:35:08,443 --> 00:35:11,507
So, the important points used in illustration,

615
00:35:11,508 --> 00:35:13,983
it also means that we already know them.

616
00:35:14,796 --> 00:35:18,062
It's important to be aware of how much you use them.

617
00:35:19,595 --> 00:35:21,853
That's what's at the heart of my class in the end.

618
00:35:22,011 --> 00:35:24,299
There are a lot of things that you've used up to now.

619
00:35:24,324 --> 00:35:26,118
I'm sure you're all using these.

620
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,374
If you've drawn before,

621
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:31,332
you've surely done things that you thought were pretty.

622
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:33,822
When you thought something was pretty,

623
00:35:33,824 --> 00:35:36,736
it's similar to the perception that people already have.

624
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:39,137
I'm sure you'd be feeling it.

625
00:35:39,405 --> 00:35:41,731
This is pretty. This is cute.

626
00:35:41,756 --> 00:35:44,065
I think this side is more attractive.

627
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:45,107
Things like that.

628
00:35:45,132 --> 00:35:49,461
But usually, you have these thoughts unconsciously.

629
00:35:51,957 --> 00:35:54,245
There's nothing that's decided.

630
00:35:54,589 --> 00:35:57,200
This is how characters appear cute.

631
00:35:57,225 --> 00:35:59,373
Unless someone decides it for me,

632
00:35:59,398 --> 00:36:01,859
actually, it's hard to be sure about that.

633
00:36:02,698 --> 00:36:04,699
But even if no one does it,

634
00:36:04,724 --> 00:36:06,724
please decide it for yourself.

635
00:36:08,308 --> 00:36:09,662
When you go in like this,

636
00:36:09,663 --> 00:36:11,642
the character looks cuter.

637
00:36:11,781 --> 00:36:13,564
When you go in like this,

638
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:15,713
it gives off a high-pressure feeling.

639
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,870
In the process of observing the illustration,

640
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:20,189
we talked about studying materials earlier.

641
00:36:20,191 --> 00:36:22,962
In the process of studying the materials,

642
00:36:22,964 --> 00:36:25,724
you set your own rules beforehand.

643
00:36:26,182 --> 00:36:28,325
And used them consciously.

644
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:30,642
We're talking about the same thing here.

645
00:36:30,903 --> 00:36:32,173
It's important.

646
00:36:36,852 --> 00:36:39,081
If you do it like this,

647
00:36:43,965 --> 00:36:47,039
to focus on the character in the middle of the cross...

648
00:36:47,582 --> 00:36:50,089
So the characters and the eyes of the people around it...

649
00:36:50,114 --> 00:36:51,633
I'm making it a cross.

650
00:36:52,248 --> 00:36:54,258
It's more like a diamond silhouette.

651
00:36:54,267 --> 00:36:57,393
I looked up a little more than I had done before.

652
00:36:57,699 --> 00:37:00,089
Should I say that it's that calm?

653
00:37:00,091 --> 00:37:02,490
The left side is a bit more stable.

654
00:37:02,965 --> 00:37:04,702
I want to show the space better.

655
00:37:04,727 --> 00:37:08,384
But thanks to the unstable feeling, the fear element was added.

656
00:37:08,409 --> 00:37:10,260
It's the second case.

657
00:37:13,163 --> 00:37:15,966
Depending on what you want,

658
00:37:15,991 --> 00:37:17,324
it can be composed differently.

659
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:19,248
I'll do one more.

660
00:37:22,398 --> 00:37:23,607
What I'm going to do this time is,

661
00:37:23,632 --> 00:37:27,400
let's think differently about the concept of space.

662
00:37:27,425 --> 00:37:29,367
The character doesn't have to stand up all the time.

663
00:37:29,392 --> 00:37:30,927
The character can sit down.

664
00:37:30,929 --> 00:37:33,500
There are times when you need to make up a situation where it lies down.

665
00:37:33,766 --> 00:37:36,827
How can I draw you lying down with an illustration?

666
00:37:37,294 --> 00:37:39,408
You can have the view as a top view.

667
00:37:39,619 --> 00:37:42,724
Like you're looking at the character lying down from the sky.

668
00:37:42,726 --> 00:37:45,505
Make the background into a blanket or something like that.

669
00:37:45,885 --> 00:37:47,839
I made a blanket like this.

670
00:37:50,771 --> 00:37:53,818
The blanket itself becomes the shape of the entire illustration.

671
00:37:53,843 --> 00:37:56,417
That's possible.

672
00:37:56,442 --> 00:37:58,159
I won't use it often, though.

673
00:38:00,484 --> 00:38:02,013
No matter what, for the conditions...

674
00:38:02,038 --> 00:38:03,641
That's what you need now.

675
00:38:03,666 --> 00:38:05,754
Can you focus on your character?

676
00:38:05,894 --> 00:38:08,130
Can you see

677
00:38:09,221 --> 00:38:10,707
the space well?

678
00:38:10,709 --> 00:38:12,534
Did the character become the main element?

679
00:38:14,113 --> 00:38:16,897
And overall, does it look fancy?

680
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:19,645
That is, can I stimulate your desire to buy it?

681
00:38:19,647 --> 00:38:21,797
If these three conditions are met, it would be good.

682
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:24,531
Portrait illustration.

683
00:38:24,722 --> 00:38:28,403
In a way, you can say that they have are fewer restrictions.

684
00:38:28,888 --> 00:38:31,737
Of course, compared to full illustrations,

685
00:38:31,762 --> 00:38:33,956
There are a lot of restrictions.

686
00:38:33,981 --> 00:38:35,129
That's true.

687
00:38:35,154 --> 00:38:38,019
I'm not saying it's too limited.

688
00:38:42,292 --> 00:38:43,610
Let's make one more example.

689
00:38:43,635 --> 00:38:47,588
This time, we're going to come up with a creature in the back.

690
00:38:47,613 --> 00:38:50,396
Until now, I showed the character first.

691
00:38:50,421 --> 00:38:52,761
Then, show the wand.

692
00:38:52,786 --> 00:38:54,381
We were able to see their eyes were connected.

693
00:38:54,406 --> 00:38:57,324
This time, I'll take this wand out on the side.

694
00:38:58,299 --> 00:38:59,899
The creature in the back.

695
00:39:00,717 --> 00:39:04,552
We're going to connect the characters and show them.

696
00:39:06,954 --> 00:39:08,507
How do we do this?

697
00:39:08,715 --> 00:39:11,390
The fact that this creature's character is sitting on it,

698
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:12,571
that's not bad.

699
00:39:13,228 --> 00:39:15,456
Let's calculate the overall flow of the gaze.

700
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:18,643
The gaze can go from top to bottom.

701
00:39:18,668 --> 00:39:21,606
Or you might look away and go in.

702
00:39:22,958 --> 00:39:25,228
If you're looking down from top to bottom,

703
00:39:25,253 --> 00:39:27,125
Or as if you're looking at it from the front.

704
00:39:27,127 --> 00:39:29,144
I think it'd be good to make the character sit down.

705
00:39:30,204 --> 00:39:32,218
If it's bent like this,

706
00:39:32,219 --> 00:39:35,740
it'd be nice if the same character was sitting on the other side.

707
00:39:36,908 --> 00:39:39,524
I think you can make it attractive either way.

708
00:39:39,549 --> 00:39:42,294
In fact, in the former one, the gaze flows down.

709
00:39:42,319 --> 00:39:44,600
It makes you feel calm unwittingly.

710
00:39:44,886 --> 00:39:47,246
So, the feeling I want to give to this character,

711
00:39:47,247 --> 00:39:48,868
it's still intense.

712
00:39:48,893 --> 00:39:51,898
But this time, this horror vibe...

713
00:39:51,899 --> 00:39:53,136
I don't want to give it to you like that.

714
00:39:53,138 --> 00:39:55,214
I mean, I don't want to give you that feeling.

715
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:57,234
I want to show it naturally.

716
00:39:57,259 --> 00:39:59,005
That's what I thought.

717
00:39:59,675 --> 00:40:01,453
For me, the 2nd one...

718
00:40:01,454 --> 00:40:03,244
The character has an S-shaped silhouette.

719
00:40:03,269 --> 00:40:04,802
We're going to do that.

720
00:40:09,388 --> 00:40:12,202
Just like the first illustration,

721
00:40:12,227 --> 00:40:14,435
the character has a strong posture.

722
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:18,517
The background elements surround the character.

723
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:20,631
I'm going to create an illustration.

724
00:40:33,618 --> 00:40:35,604
Draw as many bodies as possible

725
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:39,626
Until I can pick one easily.

726
00:40:41,002 --> 00:40:42,715
So, let's practice.

727
00:40:58,263 --> 00:41:01,158
You don't have to pull it out exactly.

728
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:04,479
It's actually the most burdensome to draw without any pressure.

729
00:41:06,473 --> 00:41:08,165
You'll know that if you've done it before.

730
00:41:08,634 --> 00:41:11,164
But they say that we should draw the human body without any burden.

731
00:41:11,164 --> 00:41:14,254
At this stage, I'm trying to make the proportions correct.

732
00:41:14,255 --> 00:41:15,486
You'll see for yourself.

733
00:41:17,319 --> 00:41:19,822
Then, 10 to 20 minutes go by so quickly.

734
00:41:20,218 --> 00:41:23,206
There will be times when it won't go as you expected.

735
00:41:23,621 --> 00:41:25,933
In that case, you have to stop on your own.

736
00:41:26,574 --> 00:41:29,384
When it's the time to keep paying attention to the human body,

737
00:41:29,409 --> 00:41:31,851
you have to check it by yourself.

738
00:41:35,619 --> 00:41:38,734
You're supposed to make your human bodies correct.

739
00:41:39,083 --> 00:41:41,271
I'll try to make it rough.

740
00:41:41,586 --> 00:41:42,766
It's okay to get it wrong.

741
00:41:43,287 --> 00:41:45,600
Let's focus on expressing our feelings.

742
00:41:53,925 --> 00:41:55,179
As expected, with this drawing,

743
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:58,348
the characters will come out small.

744
00:41:59,921 --> 00:42:02,263
I'm going to increase the face size.

745
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,919
An earlier theory that we used...

746
00:42:28,169 --> 00:42:30,901
I'll bend the ends of the face a little bit.

747
00:42:33,297 --> 00:42:35,380
You know the flow that I was going to give it?

748
00:42:35,405 --> 00:42:37,755
I'm going to make this flow stronger.

749
00:43:08,729 --> 00:43:11,926
Let's draw the face in more detail

750
00:43:11,951 --> 00:43:13,557
The face is very important in a character.

751
00:43:35,497 --> 00:43:37,898
I'll also add a simple cloth silhouette.

752
00:43:38,926 --> 00:43:41,767
That's going to cover the fundamentals of thumbnail sketches.

753
00:43:53,128 --> 00:43:55,397
I'll give you a tip here.

754
00:43:55,406 --> 00:43:57,144
When sketching the thumbnail,

755
00:43:57,169 --> 00:44:00,930
it might still be hard to draw a tentacle like this.

756
00:44:00,955 --> 00:44:03,054
What am I supposed to do with this?

757
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:04,625
There are times when you might think that.

758
00:44:04,881 --> 00:44:07,892
It's hard to draw a human body at first,

759
00:44:07,917 --> 00:44:09,892
especially the arms and legs.

760
00:44:09,917 --> 00:44:11,056
If you look at it, it stretches out.

761
00:44:11,058 --> 00:44:13,731
It might be hard to draw a cylinder like this, too.

762
00:44:13,809 --> 00:44:16,502
So, let me give you a tip.

763
00:44:17,317 --> 00:44:18,896
If it's really hard,

764
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,093
it's good to color it with dimensions.

765
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:26,071
This is called silhouette drawing.

766
00:44:28,106 --> 00:44:29,986
Organizing the canvas with dimensions.

767
00:44:29,987 --> 00:44:31,942
This is a very effective method.

768
00:44:32,387 --> 00:44:35,618
Of course, the reason why I don't recommend this method is

769
00:44:35,643 --> 00:44:38,114
because if you do it like this the first time,

770
00:44:38,116 --> 00:44:41,567
later on, when you're working on the character sketch,

771
00:44:41,569 --> 00:44:43,334
it will take

772
00:44:43,699 --> 00:44:45,391
a lot more time.

773
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,734
In the process, you'll lose your motivation.

774
00:44:47,735 --> 00:44:49,376
You will have a lot of times like that.

775
00:44:49,417 --> 00:44:51,100
The way I'm going to recommend to you today is...

776
00:44:51,101 --> 00:44:52,876
I'll show you how to do it in a line.

777
00:44:52,901 --> 00:44:54,265
If you think this

778
00:44:54,267 --> 00:44:56,162
is harder,

779
00:44:56,163 --> 00:44:58,161
it's okay to proceed with the dimensions first.

780
00:44:58,975 --> 00:45:00,844
There're other ways, too.

781
00:45:00,869 --> 00:45:02,487
I'll tell you a fun trick.

782
00:45:02,851 --> 00:45:04,264
Create one layer.

783
00:45:05,333 --> 00:45:07,919
If you press FX,

784
00:45:07,921 --> 00:45:09,806
we used Outer Glow.

785
00:45:09,831 --> 00:45:11,798
Which one are we going to use?

786
00:45:11,823 --> 00:45:13,544
What I'm going to use today is the Stroke.

787
00:45:14,008 --> 00:45:15,359
This Stroke is literally...

788
00:45:15,383 --> 00:45:18,725
I'll draw a line on the outside of what I drew.

789
00:45:18,727 --> 00:45:22,650
And if I color it in white...

790
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:32,326
If I color it in white,

791
00:45:32,351 --> 00:45:34,350
there's a black line on the outside.

792
00:45:35,297 --> 00:45:38,847
Let's use something similar that we learned before.

793
00:45:39,385 --> 00:45:41,024
When you use it as a Stroke,

794
00:45:41,049 --> 00:45:43,805
there's Opacity and Fill in the upper right corner.

795
00:45:43,922 --> 00:45:46,846
If you turn off the Fill,

796
00:45:47,243 --> 00:45:48,630
there's only a line left.

797
00:45:49,266 --> 00:45:50,664
Let's use this

798
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:53,014
to draw a tentacle.

799
00:45:53,796 --> 00:45:56,189
It's so hard to get the silhouette of the character's hair.

800
00:45:56,214 --> 00:45:58,730
It's so hard to get the silhouette of its hair.

801
00:45:58,731 --> 00:46:00,583
People who want to draw in dimensions, too...

802
00:46:00,608 --> 00:46:02,564
You can depict the hair like this.

803
00:46:05,225 --> 00:46:07,586
There are a lot of people who think this is a bit easier.

804
00:46:07,587 --> 00:46:10,289
So, while you're working on the sketch,

805
00:46:10,314 --> 00:46:12,481
and if you can't draw things like that,

806
00:46:12,506 --> 00:46:13,967
what the heck are you supposed to do?

807
00:46:13,992 --> 00:46:15,749
For those who think like that,

808
00:46:15,774 --> 00:46:17,965
you should try drawing it with dimensions.

809
00:46:17,967 --> 00:46:20,131
It'll be easier to access than you think.

810
00:46:29,272 --> 00:46:34,964
Hold the wand behind the body like this.

811
00:46:34,989 --> 00:46:36,007
It's almost invisible.

812
00:46:38,917 --> 00:46:42,574
Similar to what I discussed earlier in the 8-figure composition,

813
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:45,755
the tentacles wrap around the character.

814
00:46:53,955 --> 00:46:57,341
Let's continue to draw attention to the character.

815
00:47:23,322 --> 00:47:26,438
Let's move on to the 2nd sketch.

816
00:47:44,465 --> 00:47:48,363
One of the things that I recommend, when you make a thumbnail like this,

817
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:51,530
especially if you're a student,

818
00:47:51,667 --> 00:47:55,727
so you can get confirmation from someone,

819
00:47:55,824 --> 00:47:59,574
I'd like you to draw it without being scared, if you can.

820
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:01,815
How can I describe this later?

821
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,243
If you start removing one or two of them,

822
00:48:04,268 --> 00:48:06,151
it's hard to study.

823
00:48:06,366 --> 00:48:07,994
If you want to study for sure,

824
00:48:07,996 --> 00:48:10,887
to the point where you wonder if it's okay to do this,

825
00:48:10,912 --> 00:48:12,622
it's a good idea to start something but then

826
00:48:12,895 --> 00:48:14,581
later, in the process of fixing it,

827
00:48:14,606 --> 00:48:16,242
of course, it's hard to fix it.

828
00:48:16,267 --> 00:48:17,432
You're going to fail for sure.

829
00:48:17,738 --> 00:48:20,129
But don't be afraid of failure.

830
00:48:20,131 --> 00:48:22,933
What you do in the process of studying

831
00:48:22,958 --> 00:48:24,546
is a process of failure.

832
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:29,064
So I hope you draw as boldly as possible.

833
00:48:33,007 --> 00:48:34,727
Rather than what you think,

834
00:48:34,752 --> 00:48:36,833
I think you should do 30% of what you can do.

835
00:48:37,728 --> 00:48:40,311
It's really nice to have someone who can fix it from there.

836
00:48:40,336 --> 00:48:43,724
If you don't know anyone like that, you'll just have to take your time.

837
00:48:43,749 --> 00:48:46,503
You have to take the time to give yourself self-feedback.

838
00:48:46,813 --> 00:48:51,357
Compare good materials and pictures that you like.

839
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,422
Did I do something wrong?

840
00:48:54,447 --> 00:48:55,903
You'll try to find those parts.

841
00:48:55,928 --> 00:48:57,919
You'll go through a self-study process.

842
00:49:00,353 --> 00:49:03,291
Of course, if you're not learning from someone else,

843
00:49:03,293 --> 00:49:06,298
it'll take a long time doing it all on your own.

844
00:49:06,323 --> 00:49:09,093
But that's how you get through it by yourself.

845
00:49:09,094 --> 00:49:10,846
It's not so bad...

846
00:49:10,871 --> 00:49:14,475
The things you learn by yourself can be much more memorable, actually.

847
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:20,740
It's important to keep studying without getting depressed.

848
00:49:23,482 --> 00:49:27,172
For those who follow along with me,

849
00:49:27,197 --> 00:49:30,207
follow the way I've been doing things.

850
00:49:30,209 --> 00:49:33,000
If you're doing a portrait illustration,

851
00:49:33,001 --> 00:49:34,475
those of you who are studying,

852
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,855
I hope you try your best.

853
00:49:37,476 --> 00:49:38,895
Ask yourself if you can do that much.

854
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,308
Yes, try it.

855
00:49:41,196 --> 00:49:43,251
If you can't, you can think about it later.

856
00:49:44,991 --> 00:49:46,559
That's my life motto.

857
00:49:46,699 --> 00:49:49,804
What happens later is what happens later.

858
00:49:50,867 --> 00:49:53,662
Worrying about the future doesn't mean you can prepare for something.

859
00:50:14,916 --> 00:50:16,878
The character has become more mature, right.

860
00:50:16,895 --> 00:50:19,727
I'm going to make its face bigger to cover that feeling.

861
00:50:22,774 --> 00:50:24,577
I'm going to make the hat bigger, too.

862
00:50:37,879 --> 00:50:40,722
What I'm telling you in this class

863
00:50:40,747 --> 00:50:47,102
are the same things that I always pay attention to when I work.

864
00:50:47,315 --> 00:50:49,508
What's the gaze flow?

865
00:50:49,862 --> 00:50:52,222
What are the parts you want to show off?

866
00:50:53,784 --> 00:50:55,699
How are you going to show the perspective?

867
00:50:55,724 --> 00:50:57,146
How are you going to organize the space?

868
00:50:57,148 --> 00:50:58,559
What are you going to do with the silhouette?

869
00:50:58,584 --> 00:51:02,116
These are all things I think about when I work.

870
00:51:02,117 --> 00:51:04,643
They're critical.

871
00:51:05,965 --> 00:51:10,263
If there's an illustration that you're still working on,

872
00:51:10,288 --> 00:51:13,135
go through the process of self-feedback.

873
00:51:14,361 --> 00:51:16,087
There are people who can't do this well.

874
00:51:16,112 --> 00:51:18,002
As much as I've been working for a long time...

875
00:51:18,027 --> 00:51:19,726
What's important when you draw is,

876
00:51:20,345 --> 00:51:23,013
for those who work a lot each day,

877
00:51:23,015 --> 00:51:25,537
they work about 7 hours a day.

878
00:51:25,785 --> 00:51:27,202
As for those who do it more,

879
00:51:27,204 --> 00:51:29,163
sometimes, it can be up to 10 hours.

880
00:51:29,834 --> 00:51:31,777
Everyone has a different level of physical strength.

881
00:51:32,249 --> 00:51:34,154
We have a different amount of time to work.

882
00:51:34,156 --> 00:51:35,639
Of course there are differences depending on the person.

883
00:51:36,489 --> 00:51:39,721
But the important thing is to have enough time to draw.

884
00:51:39,746 --> 00:51:43,012
I'm sure there are times when I work longer than an hour.

885
00:51:43,448 --> 00:51:44,845
As that happens,

886
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:48,763
drawing is not about maintaining great concentration for a short period of time.

887
00:51:49,019 --> 00:51:53,319
I think it's more about maintaining loose concentration for a long time.

888
00:51:53,336 --> 00:51:54,565
It's very important.

889
00:51:54,884 --> 00:51:56,664
But in that process,

890
00:51:56,665 --> 00:51:59,343
You'll have no choice but to spend some time blankly.

891
00:51:59,378 --> 00:52:03,661
In the meantime, there will be some days when you draw mindlessly.

892
00:52:03,976 --> 00:52:07,948
When that happens, you'll stop in the middle.

893
00:52:07,973 --> 00:52:10,537
It feels like a switch goes off in myself.

894
00:52:10,888 --> 00:52:12,921
Like stepping on a trigger.

895
00:52:12,946 --> 00:52:16,098
Stop and see if what you're doing is right.

896
00:52:16,192 --> 00:52:18,863
It's essential to take time to verify it.

897
00:52:19,188 --> 00:52:22,979
For those who find it hard to take that kind of time,

898
00:52:23,004 --> 00:52:25,630
it's good to set an alarm.

899
00:52:25,857 --> 00:52:31,523
When I work on something, I set an alarm every 2-3 hours.

900
00:52:31,548 --> 00:52:35,466
When the alarm goes off, you stop and look at your drawing.

901
00:52:35,491 --> 00:52:37,629
You look at the picture from another person's point of view.

902
00:52:38,134 --> 00:52:39,845
There are many ways to analyze it.

903
00:52:39,846 --> 00:52:42,551
There are people who check it on their mobile screens.

904
00:52:44,284 --> 00:52:45,765
There are people who flip it over.

905
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:48,050
That's a way to use the reversal function.

906
00:52:48,314 --> 00:52:50,444
Starting with the left and right reversal.

907
00:52:51,521 --> 00:52:53,942
And it's a good idea to check with someone else.

908
00:52:54,682 --> 00:52:57,231
It's a way to compare yours with other illustrations.

909
00:52:57,256 --> 00:52:59,500
I use various methods.

910
00:53:01,666 --> 00:53:03,313
I don't think there's any errors.

911
00:53:04,285 --> 00:53:06,767
I'm not sure if what I want to do is going well.

912
00:53:06,792 --> 00:53:07,895
Those are the most important things.

913
00:53:08,684 --> 00:53:11,906
I'm uncertain if what I hope to show you is being expressed well.

914
00:53:12,929 --> 00:53:17,547
You have to think about that before going into it because it's an illustration.

915
00:53:18,427 --> 00:53:21,161
If your concentration is too good,

916
00:53:23,259 --> 00:53:26,473
if you were so focused while you were working on it,

917
00:53:29,103 --> 00:53:31,518
if you're not good at stopping and thinking,

918
00:53:31,543 --> 00:53:33,950
it's really good to set an alarm and step back from it.

919
00:53:38,928 --> 00:53:41,828
You don't have to be sad that you can't do that.

920
00:53:41,829 --> 00:53:45,243
If you focus on one thing, you can't pay attention to other things.

921
00:53:45,475 --> 00:53:47,578
If you focus on the details,

922
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:50,256
if you don't care about the overall balance,

923
00:53:50,281 --> 00:53:52,477
when you focus on a part of it, your concentration

924
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:54,219
will be stronger than for others.

925
00:53:54,722 --> 00:53:57,075
That's a strength in a different sense.

926
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:58,935
The pros and cons always come together.

927
00:54:00,103 --> 00:54:01,583
Think positively.

928
00:54:03,434 --> 00:54:06,703
You just have to cover the areas that are weak.

929
00:54:06,937 --> 00:54:08,507
I chattered along like this.

930
00:54:08,779 --> 00:54:11,470
I've done the 2nd sketch of this character.

931
00:54:11,495 --> 00:54:13,366
Let's compare them and take a look.

932
00:54:26,448 --> 00:54:28,425
We made three compositions.

933
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:31,883
The character has a dynamic vibe.

934
00:54:31,936 --> 00:54:34,638
The first step is for the creature in the back to assist it.

935
00:54:34,747 --> 00:54:37,137
I'll show you the character and the wand first.

936
00:54:37,162 --> 00:54:39,016
We went into the order for showing the creature.

937
00:54:39,236 --> 00:54:43,506
And I wanted to show a scary feeling to the character.

938
00:54:43,531 --> 00:54:46,568
The second time I intentionally made it look different.

939
00:54:46,948 --> 00:54:49,705
It has a strong effect behind the character.

940
00:54:49,707 --> 00:54:51,299
I'm going to fill in the fancy atmosphere.

941
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:54,073
Compared to the left side,

942
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:57,942
it's close to the inverted triangular composition. I'll put a lot of weight on the top.

943
00:54:58,243 --> 00:55:01,727
It's unstable but intense.

944
00:55:04,118 --> 00:55:06,081
The characters and the creature in the back.

945
00:55:06,081 --> 00:55:07,829
It's the 3rd one that created a natural connection.

946
00:55:08,182 --> 00:55:11,563
Since the character is sitting on top of an object,

947
00:55:11,588 --> 00:55:13,880
compared to the two friends I drew earlier,

948
00:55:14,195 --> 00:55:17,443
it's much easier to predict the spatiality.

949
00:55:19,472 --> 00:55:21,040
The tentacles in the front, too,

950
00:55:21,065 --> 00:55:24,106
contributed to the whole thing.

951
00:55:24,544 --> 00:55:29,759
The tentacles in front of us and the head where the character is sitting.

952
00:55:30,608 --> 00:55:33,424
The head of the tentacles, the tentacles at the back.

953
00:55:33,449 --> 00:55:36,714
The illustration is in three layers.

954
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:40,027
Showing the space with all the layers is

955
00:55:40,052 --> 00:55:41,238
the third case.

956
00:55:41,612 --> 00:55:43,886
Each of us wants to show something.

957
00:55:43,911 --> 00:55:46,433
You'll be able to see what's in there.

958
00:55:46,458 --> 00:55:47,922
Like I said,

959
00:55:47,947 --> 00:55:50,163
the diamond composition close to a triangular one,

960
00:55:50,188 --> 00:55:52,379
you'll see that it's used very often.

961
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:54,831
If you organize the screen like this,

962
00:55:54,856 --> 00:55:58,256
there will be some objects that can be used in person.

963
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,685
So, you need to follow your character's mood

964
00:56:02,687 --> 00:56:04,965
to create an illustration, and to do that,

965
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:07,231
what would you do when you create a cute character?

966
00:56:07,317 --> 00:56:09,257
What should you do when you want to give a calm vibe?

967
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:11,862
That's what's in the end of the class.

968
00:56:11,887 --> 00:56:14,207
Let's do it together then.

969
00:56:14,367 --> 00:56:16,452
I'm going to grab one of these

970
00:56:16,477 --> 00:56:18,729
and I'll draw the lines and color the characters.

971
00:56:18,754 --> 00:56:21,298
Next time, I'm going to try the color roughing stage.

972
00:56:21,425 --> 00:56:22,633
This time, before...

973
00:56:22,643 --> 00:56:25,611
I didn't tell you much about the full illustration process.

974
00:56:25,621 --> 00:56:28,460
It's in the light and shade stage, so we're going to talk

975
00:56:28,485 --> 00:56:29,935
more about it in detail.

976
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:34,166
That's all I've got to say for now so I'll wrap up today's class.

977
00:56:34,184 --> 00:56:35,856
Thank you for your hard work.
