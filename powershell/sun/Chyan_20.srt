00:00:07,052 --> 00:00:08,092
Hello.

3
00:00:08,117 --> 00:00:09,625
Today is our last lecture.

4
00:00:10,234 --> 00:00:13,055
We'll review what we've done so far.

5
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,250
I'm going to summarize a few things.

6
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:18,289
And while you study,

7
00:00:18,327 --> 00:00:20,640
I'm going to say

8
00:00:20,642 --> 00:00:23,107
what I couldn't before

9
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:25,718
or things that I want to tell you from now on.

10
00:00:25,813 --> 00:00:28,314
Thank you for following through with this long course.

11
00:00:28,316 --> 00:00:29,875
I really appreciate it.

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,373
I'm sure some of you

13
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:33,522
took my class while drawing.

14
00:00:33,547 --> 00:00:35,311
Some others

15
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:37,461
may have just watched the videos.

16
00:00:37,486 --> 00:00:39,117
For those of you who followed along with me,

17
00:00:39,142 --> 00:00:41,584
in this lecture, look at what you drew so far

18
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:43,006
and see if you missed anything.

19
00:00:43,031 --> 00:00:45,475
I hope you can take a look.

20
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,202
For those who just watched the videos,

21
00:00:47,204 --> 00:00:50,045
use what I've told you so far

22
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,883
and draw full illustrations and portrait illustration

23
00:00:51,908 --> 00:00:53,623
as you make reference to

24
00:00:53,648 --> 00:00:56,718
photo materials.

25
00:00:56,743 --> 00:00:59,430
Let's summarize what we've done so far

26
00:00:59,455 --> 00:01:01,513
and let's take this time to wrap things up.

27
00:01:02,555 --> 00:01:09,991
We learned

28
00:01:10,016 --> 00:01:11,912
what an illustration is all about.

29
00:01:12,295 --> 00:01:14,186
In the end, an illustration

30
00:01:14,211 --> 00:01:16,381
is all about composing the square canvas

31
00:01:16,663 --> 00:01:20,020
or the overall silhouette of the character.

32
00:01:20,045 --> 00:01:22,749
But, in the end, it's not just about making up a character.

33
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,740
It's about composing the viewer's gaze

34
00:01:25,698 --> 00:01:27,356
and inducing it.

35
00:01:27,381 --> 00:01:30,709
We also learned that expressing the key elements are important.

36
00:01:30,734 --> 00:01:33,615
That's what illustrations are about.

37
00:01:34,202 --> 00:01:36,958
So, when we draw characters,

38
00:01:36,983 --> 00:01:40,197
characters are just the subject matter.

39
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:43,884
Illustration is all about 'cooking' a tasty dish with the character.

40
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:47,373
In a way, the process of cooking

41
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:49,427
is just like the process of

42
00:01:49,452 --> 00:01:50,771
of drawing illustrations.

43
00:01:50,796 --> 00:01:57,555
To do that, in Section 2,

44
00:01:57,557 --> 00:01:59,318
I taught you about the basics.

45
00:02:00,147 --> 00:02:01,992
Well, it's embarrassing to say that

46
00:02:01,994 --> 00:02:03,716
because I didn't teach you a lot.

47
00:02:03,741 --> 00:02:05,770
I think that part could be a little disappointing.

48
00:02:05,795 --> 00:02:07,342
But with the basics,

49
00:02:07,344 --> 00:02:10,770
of course, it would be good if I taught all of them to you.

50
00:02:10,795 --> 00:02:13,615
But, there's a lot of information on the internet.

51
00:02:13,725 --> 00:02:16,459
So, check out the muscles of the human body there

52
00:02:16,484 --> 00:02:18,817
and build up your basics.

53
00:02:18,842 --> 00:02:21,155
That's why you need to learn from other sources.

54
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,982
Eventually, this process will take a lot of time.

55
00:02:25,123 --> 00:02:26,608
But you need to spend a lot of time on it.

56
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,934
Compared to other processes,

57
00:02:28,147 --> 00:02:33,114
normally, if you go to an art school and learn something,

58
00:02:33,116 --> 00:02:34,777
when it comes to coloring,

59
00:02:34,802 --> 00:02:36,573
you will eventually get better.

60
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:38,706
I think in this case, one month would be the basic unit of time.

61
00:02:38,731 --> 00:02:41,978
I'd say if you learn coloring for 7 to 8 months,

62
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,542
you can certainly improve.

63
00:02:44,567 --> 00:02:46,069
In case of the whole illustration process,

64
00:02:46,071 --> 00:02:47,191
the time unit would be one year.

65
00:02:47,216 --> 00:02:49,911
If you want to draw well to a certain extent,

66
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:53,011
it takes 3 to 4 years.

67
00:02:53,036 --> 00:02:56,434
So, it takes a lot of time to

68
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:57,384
be better at drawing.

69
00:02:57,438 --> 00:02:58,771
When it comes to training,

70
00:02:58,773 --> 00:03:01,738
that's why you can't understand this right away.

71
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,157
Does that mean you should come back in 3-4 years?

72
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,124
It's not like that.

73
00:03:05,126 --> 00:03:08,020
We learned how to simplify when we were learning the basics.

74
00:03:09,473 --> 00:03:12,370
And with a simplified body,

75
00:03:12,372 --> 00:03:14,352
I told you

76
00:03:14,354 --> 00:03:15,612
that you can draw characters.

77
00:03:15,637 --> 00:03:18,502
So, we're going to use simplified human bodies

78
00:03:18,504 --> 00:03:20,501
and draw a simple human body.

79
00:03:20,503 --> 00:03:23,988
Let's practice how to draw just like you want to.

80
00:03:24,548 --> 00:03:26,116
Let's get to it.

81
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:27,308
So, what did we learn?

82
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:38,997
The human body is divided into basic movements, proportions, and outlines.

83
00:03:39,784 --> 00:03:41,462
Out of movement, proportions, and outlines,

84
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:43,063
movement is the most important.

85
00:03:43,088 --> 00:03:44,128
The second most important is the proportions.

86
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,572
The third would be the outlines.

87
00:03:46,885 --> 00:03:48,557
Out of movement, proportions, and lines,

88
00:03:48,574 --> 00:03:50,337
the first thing you should learn is

89
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,463
the proportions.

90
00:03:53,026 --> 00:03:55,087
You should know the proportions

91
00:03:55,112 --> 00:03:57,243
for your deformed, or modified characters.

92
00:03:57,268 --> 00:03:59,046
Now, with that in mind,

93
00:03:59,048 --> 00:04:00,982
make a mannequin in your head.

94
00:04:00,984 --> 00:04:04,843
Make a base mannequin that's the basis of your ideal human body.

95
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:07,851
Using that, give it many movements

96
00:04:07,853 --> 00:04:09,759
and various angles.

97
00:04:09,784 --> 00:04:13,436
You have to train how to move

98
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:15,932
and spin your imaginary body.

99
00:04:16,706 --> 00:04:18,049
After doing that,

100
00:04:18,074 --> 00:04:19,698
from the human body that you drew,

101
00:04:19,723 --> 00:04:21,440
it's good if you study more about the outlines

102
00:04:21,465 --> 00:04:24,743
to express

103
00:04:24,768 --> 00:04:27,227
more attractive things.

104
00:04:27,252 --> 00:04:29,017
Whether it's the fat or the muscles,

105
00:04:29,042 --> 00:04:31,248
or the creases of clothes or the hair,

106
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,012
study how to draw outlines additionally,

107
00:04:34,014 --> 00:04:35,836
so that from the basic body type that you drew,

108
00:04:35,838 --> 00:04:38,531
you'll make a more attractive basic version.

109
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:40,845
That's how you will practice.

110
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,729
This is the basic framework of the human body.

111
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:48,318
For your information, the proportions, movements, and lines

112
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,932
that I mentioned,

113
00:04:51,268 --> 00:04:53,053
they could be applied to characters,

114
00:04:53,078 --> 00:04:55,550
and animals as well.

115
00:04:55,575 --> 00:04:57,617
Most of them are included.

116
00:04:58,153 --> 00:05:00,342
Even when you're drawing a dog or a cat,

117
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,504
you have to make sure the movements are correct.

118
00:05:02,506 --> 00:05:04,780
You should make sure the proportions are correct first.

119
00:05:04,782 --> 00:05:06,001
Then, you would make sure the outlines are correct.

120
00:05:06,003 --> 00:05:08,446
So in terms of their importance,

121
00:05:08,448 --> 00:05:12,539
it will be the same for characters and animals.

122
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:15,303
So please remember these things.

123
00:05:15,328 --> 00:05:17,861
So, now that you can

124
00:05:17,863 --> 00:05:19,686
draw a character to some extent,

125
00:05:19,711 --> 00:05:23,452
now you're going to practice how to actually draw.

126
00:05:23,477 --> 00:05:26,589
This is what was included in Section 3.

127
00:05:26,591 --> 00:05:28,281
Before we actually draw professionally,

128
00:05:28,283 --> 00:05:31,671
it's good to know what you want to do.

129
00:05:31,696 --> 00:05:34,523
When you actually draw professionally,

130
00:05:34,525 --> 00:05:38,458
if you want to be hired

131
00:05:39,758 --> 00:05:42,877
and make money with your illustrations,

132
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:48,016
you'd either draw concept art, or do character illustrations.

133
00:05:49,508 --> 00:05:51,328
You might also draw full illustrations,

134
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,188
or simply draw fan art and make money that way.

135
00:05:57,758 --> 00:05:59,079
There are many different ways.

136
00:05:59,081 --> 00:06:01,044
Depending on what you want to do, you need to know different things.

137
00:06:01,046 --> 00:06:03,319
In the case of concept art and character illustrations,

138
00:06:03,344 --> 00:06:04,912
you need design skills.

139
00:06:05,403 --> 00:06:06,452
And for illustrations,

140
00:06:06,477 --> 00:06:08,534
you need composition skills.

141
00:06:08,559 --> 00:06:09,777
The same goes for fan art, too.

142
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:10,679
As for fan art,

143
00:06:10,681 --> 00:06:12,064
it focuses more on

144
00:06:12,066 --> 00:06:13,331
expressing the character's charm.

145
00:06:13,356 --> 00:06:15,143
But, you won't have to do much design work.

146
00:06:15,145 --> 00:06:17,113
So, everyone needs different things.

147
00:06:17,138 --> 00:06:19,120
That's why you need to keep that in mind,

148
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,375
and it's good to be able to decide what you need quickly.

149
00:06:21,377 --> 00:06:22,799
If you can't decide, just get on with it.

150
00:06:22,824 --> 00:06:25,231
It's okay to draw first and decide later.

151
00:06:25,865 --> 00:06:27,262
But, it's important to decide your path as quickly as possible.

152
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:28,699
Just decide your own path first,

153
00:06:28,701 --> 00:06:30,706
no matter how you do it.

154
00:06:30,731 --> 00:06:32,441
Why is it important to decide that?

155
00:06:32,466 --> 00:06:34,659
So that you can make sure of where you're going.

156
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:36,800
You can change it later

157
00:06:36,825 --> 00:06:38,683
if you wish.

158
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,722
While you were practicing concept art,

159
00:06:40,747 --> 00:06:43,184
you might suddenly want to do illustrations.

160
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:46,027
If you can't stand it, you change your goals.

161
00:06:46,052 --> 00:06:48,356
Your skills will improve no matter what,

162
00:06:48,381 --> 00:06:49,417
as long as you're drawing.

163
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:52,348
It's just that your artistic path won't be a straight road.

164
00:06:52,575 --> 00:06:55,128
Your skills will improve continuously anyway.

165
00:06:55,153 --> 00:06:57,146
I compared it to raising your bar before, right?

166
00:06:57,148 --> 00:06:59,059
It's like raising your bar of skills.

167
00:06:59,184 --> 00:07:01,009
Your skills will be formed one way or another.

168
00:07:01,011 --> 00:07:02,790
So, you'll have some chances.

169
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:05,328
First of all, decide what you're doing right now.

170
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,684
That will help you speed up the process.

171
00:07:08,686 --> 00:07:10,637
Just keep that in mind and continue.

172
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,436
We learned the basics.

173
00:07:13,438 --> 00:07:17,144
And after that,

174
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:19,762
we learned about the gaze and the silhouette.

175
00:07:21,755 --> 00:07:25,277
It's also the most important part of illustration.

176
00:07:25,302 --> 00:07:28,168
I also taught you about lighting.

177
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:30,638
In the end, this is all about

178
00:07:30,663 --> 00:07:33,411
making the viewers see

179
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,399
the main elements first,

180
00:07:38,674 --> 00:07:39,997
and then the sub elements,

181
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:42,909
and then the extra elements.

182
00:07:43,528 --> 00:07:45,784
We learned how the viewer's gaze will flow

183
00:07:45,809 --> 00:07:47,934
and how we will compose the canvas.

184
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:49,372
Dot, line, and plane.

185
00:07:51,127 --> 00:07:52,724
A triangular silhouette,

186
00:07:52,995 --> 00:07:54,449
a diamond silhouette,

187
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,488
an 8-shaped silhouette.

188
00:07:55,513 --> 00:07:57,002
In the case of lighting,

189
00:07:57,004 --> 00:07:58,346
we need to focus on where the light would come in.

190
00:07:59,505 --> 00:08:01,292
We could either give a Spotlight,

191
00:08:01,317 --> 00:08:02,893
or apply Hard Light or Soft Light.

192
00:08:02,895 --> 00:08:04,268
There're many things you could do.

193
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,995
Or you can use complementary colors

194
00:08:06,606 --> 00:08:08,642
or similar colors

195
00:08:08,644 --> 00:08:10,692
and use all of that

196
00:08:10,717 --> 00:08:12,427
to compose the gaze.

197
00:08:12,452 --> 00:08:15,526
You should think about

198
00:08:15,551 --> 00:08:18,628
whether you could draw people's attention to where you wanted

199
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,644
and contain all the important parts there.

200
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:23,016
In other words, did you express what you wanted to?

201
00:08:23,018 --> 00:08:24,371
Think about this every time

202
00:08:24,373 --> 00:08:26,175
when you compose an illustration.

203
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,989
Usually, people who draw for the first time,

204
00:08:29,014 --> 00:08:31,017
in other words, people who are self-taught

205
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:32,768
without learning from anyone,

206
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,925
for those people,

207
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,465
they would have just drawn without thinking.

208
00:08:36,942 --> 00:08:38,847
Rather than thinking about the gaze,

209
00:08:38,872 --> 00:08:40,554
they would have copied other drawings

210
00:08:40,555 --> 00:08:42,103
or photo references.

211
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:44,534
They might have just started with a character that's standing up.

212
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,613
Maybe that's how you started drawing.

213
00:08:46,638 --> 00:08:50,004
Of course, that's helpful.

214
00:08:50,006 --> 00:08:52,338
It's helpful from the perspective of drawing characters,

215
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:54,894
but it doesn't help much when you're composing.

216
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:57,505
So if you continue to draw like that,

217
00:08:57,507 --> 00:08:59,297
your skills will improve, but,

218
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:00,590
what happens is,

219
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:03,785
it's hard to get the illustration that you want.

220
00:09:03,786 --> 00:09:06,505
You can still draw characters to a certain extent

221
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:07,444
if you take your time.

222
00:09:07,469 --> 00:09:09,820
But since you would always draw the same thing,

223
00:09:09,822 --> 00:09:11,637
it's hard to draw various things.

224
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:13,379
And when you want to give your drawing a different vibe,

225
00:09:13,404 --> 00:09:15,909
it might not have the feeling that you want.

226
00:09:15,934 --> 00:09:20,194
Or you might not know how to approach it.

227
00:09:20,195 --> 00:09:22,614
It might look okay at the roughing -n stage, but it might look terrible once it's completed.

228
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:24,667
These kinds of problems will happen.

229
00:09:24,692 --> 00:09:27,388
So in the end, to solve all these problems,

230
00:09:27,413 --> 00:09:29,817
eventually, you need to know about the gaze.

231
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,731
How do you show the areas you want?

232
00:09:32,756 --> 00:09:33,942
How will you express it?

233
00:09:34,427 --> 00:09:36,402
But if you don't know

234
00:09:36,404 --> 00:09:37,888
how to do it well,

235
00:09:37,913 --> 00:09:39,265
including this area,

236
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,816
and the human body area as well,

237
00:09:40,841 --> 00:09:41,789
in all...

238
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,324
There was something that I emphasized in Section 1.

239
00:09:44,349 --> 00:09:47,607
To be honest, I wanted to say this again at the end.

240
00:09:47,608 --> 00:09:49,739
It's how to use materials, or references.

241
00:09:53,395 --> 00:09:55,488
References help you

242
00:09:55,513 --> 00:09:58,516
create the information in your head

243
00:09:58,517 --> 00:10:01,620
without actually experiencing it.

244
00:10:01,645 --> 00:10:03,724
So these references

245
00:10:03,726 --> 00:10:05,920
would be adding something to your head.

246
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:11,243
The gaze, the silhouettes, and the lighting that are used in the actual drawing stage

247
00:10:11,245 --> 00:10:14,698
is all about the process of printing out what's in your head.

248
00:10:15,013 --> 00:10:16,028
It's the process of printing things out

249
00:10:16,567 --> 00:10:18,464
from your head.

250
00:10:18,489 --> 00:10:20,112
You have to update the data in your head

251
00:10:20,113 --> 00:10:21,870
so that there's going to be a lot to print out.

252
00:10:21,895 --> 00:10:23,263
You need to have a lot of data in your head.

253
00:10:23,288 --> 00:10:24,900
So that a lot will come out when you print it out.

254
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:27,422
Then, to increase the capacity of your head,

255
00:10:27,424 --> 00:10:30,636
you need to rely on references.

256
00:10:31,403 --> 00:10:33,324
And of course, the curriculum you've seen so far

257
00:10:33,349 --> 00:10:35,739
would be included

258
00:10:35,764 --> 00:10:37,425
in this 'data'.

259
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:38,773
Including such things,

260
00:10:38,775 --> 00:10:41,442
you get the information you see from these sources.

261
00:10:41,638 --> 00:10:43,472
In the process of collecting this information,

262
00:10:43,497 --> 00:10:46,215
I told you that you must go through the analyzing process.

263
00:10:48,005 --> 00:10:50,077
When you look at references,

264
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,308
you shouldn't just say it's 'pretty'.

265
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,307
Why is it so pretty?

266
00:10:54,638 --> 00:10:56,972
How does the gaze of people flow?

267
00:10:56,997 --> 00:10:58,969
What would happen if you flip your drawing vertically?

268
00:10:58,971 --> 00:11:00,855
How would it look from a different perspective?

269
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,601
How would other colors look in the illustration?

270
00:11:02,603 --> 00:11:03,988
Edit things by yourself,

271
00:11:04,013 --> 00:11:06,039
and see what happens if you draw with your own style.

272
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,036
Try to copy and draw,

273
00:11:08,061 --> 00:11:10,520
and please use that as a reference somehow.

274
00:11:10,638 --> 00:11:13,808
So, put additional information into your head,

275
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,983
and when your head is 'updated',

276
00:11:15,984 --> 00:11:18,012
if you do the actual work,

277
00:11:18,013 --> 00:11:20,817
I'm sure that your results can be readily used in the field.

278
00:11:20,842 --> 00:11:23,047
You'll be able to produce high-quality work.

279
00:11:23,395 --> 00:11:24,989
At that point,

280
00:11:25,106 --> 00:11:27,291
it's all about gaining more experience

281
00:11:27,293 --> 00:11:29,402
and it's about increasing your perfection.

282
00:11:29,404 --> 00:11:32,802
I talked about the difference between quality and perfection.

283
00:11:33,653 --> 00:11:36,600
Quality is the perfection of the composition itself.

284
00:11:36,602 --> 00:11:38,167
On the other hand, perfection is about

285
00:11:38,192 --> 00:11:39,941
how clean the final result is,

286
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:41,528
to the point that you can use it in the field.

287
00:11:41,553 --> 00:11:43,996
It's about whether it comes out clean and in high quality.

288
00:11:44,653 --> 00:11:46,169
When it comes to things like this,

289
00:11:46,194 --> 00:11:48,309
the most important thing is the front area.

290
00:11:48,334 --> 00:11:50,194
In other words, in terms of the composition of the illustration,

291
00:11:50,219 --> 00:11:54,496
it's important to have a full composition.

292
00:11:54,521 --> 00:11:56,423
So, you should

293
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:57,566
focus on those areas.

294
00:11:58,059 --> 00:11:59,899
After doing that,

295
00:11:59,901 --> 00:12:03,056
we looked at a full illustration and a portrait illustration.

296
00:12:03,058 --> 00:12:04,434
We looked at two examples.

297
00:12:10,849 --> 00:12:13,081
Usually, the thing that applies here

298
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:17,884
is that character illustration and concept art

299
00:12:17,909 --> 00:12:20,423
is closer to portrait illustration.

300
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,009
For full illustration and fan art,

301
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,986
it would literally be full illustrations.

302
00:12:26,151 --> 00:12:28,174
That's why you're going to practice like that.

303
00:12:28,276 --> 00:12:30,549
When you make a full illustration,

304
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,905
You should practice more from what you did above.

305
00:12:32,906 --> 00:12:34,521
When you practice,

306
00:12:34,522 --> 00:12:35,941
and when it comes to lighting,

307
00:12:36,792 --> 00:12:41,433
or when it comes to the concept of coloring,

308
00:12:41,435 --> 00:12:44,252
I hope you invest more time.

309
00:12:44,495 --> 00:12:46,425
Because you'll have more freedom of expression,

310
00:12:46,426 --> 00:12:48,790
compared to portrait illustration,

311
00:12:48,815 --> 00:12:51,267
I hope you can use a variety of colors.

312
00:12:51,292 --> 00:12:53,606
If I were to add one more thing,

313
00:12:53,608 --> 00:12:54,947
I guess it would be composing the canvas.

314
00:12:55,143 --> 00:12:58,307
The reason why composing the canvas is more important

315
00:12:58,309 --> 00:12:59,549
is because it's like free-styling.

316
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:02,603
The character could be lying down

317
00:13:02,628 --> 00:13:04,462
or it could be upside-down.

318
00:13:04,487 --> 00:13:05,760
When we cut the canvas in half,

319
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,033
the left and right canvases could look different.

320
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:10,799
The characters could change,

321
00:13:11,366 --> 00:13:13,293
and the skirt of the character that's lying down

322
00:13:13,295 --> 00:13:14,932
could be in different colors.

323
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,314
Or you could direct it differently.

324
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:20,204
You could see the background inside the character's outfit,

325
00:13:20,229 --> 00:13:22,907
or see a different background through the character's eyes.

326
00:13:22,932 --> 00:13:24,112
Like that,

327
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,831
there are various ways of directing when you're illustrating.

328
00:13:27,191 --> 00:13:30,894
I don't think I even showed you 7% of how you could direct things in this class.

329
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:33,181
That's how free illustrations can be.

330
00:13:33,206 --> 00:13:36,220
As such, analyze other illustrations

331
00:13:36,245 --> 00:13:39,013
and see what other types of direction are possible.

332
00:13:39,015 --> 00:13:40,689
You should continue expanding your experiences

333
00:13:40,714 --> 00:13:43,501
after this.

334
00:13:43,526 --> 00:13:46,158
So, I think it's a good idea to study more.

335
00:13:46,183 --> 00:13:49,077
When you draw a full illustration,

336
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,347
focus on coloring

337
00:13:50,348 --> 00:13:52,517
to train yourself.

338
00:13:52,542 --> 00:13:56,167
If you want to make money with full illustrations,

339
00:13:56,192 --> 00:13:59,372
or if you wish to gain recognition with your fan art,

340
00:13:59,397 --> 00:14:02,158
I'm sure you'll see how it affects your skills.

341
00:14:02,183 --> 00:14:03,534
Especially recently,

342
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:05,908
there are so many illustrators.

343
00:14:05,933 --> 00:14:09,636
That also means you have a lot of rivals.

344
00:14:09,661 --> 00:14:11,073
There is so much competition,

345
00:14:11,098 --> 00:14:13,322
and there are a lot of people who are really good at drawing.

346
00:14:13,347 --> 00:14:16,228
There are already a lot of people like that.

347
00:14:16,253 --> 00:14:18,006
But now, drawing is even more accessible.

348
00:14:18,007 --> 00:14:20,050
There are so many social media services these days.

349
00:14:20,051 --> 00:14:23,136
There's Twitter, Pixiv, and

350
00:14:23,161 --> 00:14:25,470
dozens of other sites where pictures come up.

351
00:14:25,495 --> 00:14:26,633
In such places,

352
00:14:26,635 --> 00:14:30,173
there are more ways that you can earn money from your own work.

353
00:14:30,198 --> 00:14:34,033
In the past, if you were to make money by drawing,

354
00:14:34,035 --> 00:14:35,221
you would earn money with game illustrations.

355
00:14:35,223 --> 00:14:36,775
Or you would just create fan art

356
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,590
and sell it to other fans.

357
00:14:38,592 --> 00:14:40,261
The only way to earn money

358
00:14:40,286 --> 00:14:44,072
was to sell fanzines in the past.

359
00:14:44,097 --> 00:14:47,401
But recently, you can upload your works on Patreon.

360
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,930
It's a site where you could be sponsored based on your art.

361
00:14:50,955 --> 00:14:53,517
Patreon, Pixiv, or Fan Box.

362
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:55,078
You can be sponsored from all these sites.

363
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:58,009
Or recently, there's a site that auctions paintings.

364
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:01,103
Digital drawings (NFTs) are also auctioned off,

365
00:15:01,128 --> 00:15:04,196
and I heard that there are cases where you can earn Bitcoin or crypto through that.

366
00:15:05,034 --> 00:15:08,984
So, you can make money by drawing your own work

367
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:10,836
and there are many new ways.

368
00:15:10,861 --> 00:15:14,095
Illustrators will improve their quality

369
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,728
and the standard will be higher.

370
00:15:16,251 --> 00:15:18,664
In order for us to adapt to that,

371
00:15:18,665 --> 00:15:20,770
we have no choice but to keep looking at references.

372
00:15:21,908 --> 00:15:23,828
I'm sure you've seen them before, but,

373
00:15:23,853 --> 00:15:25,587
teenagers from the 2020s,

374
00:15:27,064 --> 00:15:28,298
let me say it again,

375
00:15:28,524 --> 00:15:32,524
if you compare the drawings of teenagers from the 2000s

376
00:15:33,197 --> 00:15:36,167
and the drawings of teenagers from the 2010s,

377
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:38,283
teenagers in the 2010s

378
00:15:38,285 --> 00:15:40,329
are better at drawing.

379
00:15:40,619 --> 00:15:42,588
It's inevitable because

380
00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:45,853
they have more accessible materials.

381
00:15:46,056 --> 00:15:48,289
They had more access to materials,

382
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:49,818
and even if they didn't analyze them much,

383
00:15:49,819 --> 00:15:52,051
there are still things that stay in their heads.

384
00:15:52,053 --> 00:15:55,002
And because they draw using those things,

385
00:15:55,003 --> 00:15:57,923
compared to teenagers who drew in the 2000s,

386
00:15:57,948 --> 00:15:59,681
they are better at drawing.

387
00:16:00,301 --> 00:16:01,212
What does that mean?

388
00:16:01,237 --> 00:16:02,486
If you use references well,

389
00:16:02,511 --> 00:16:05,212
it means that you can improve your skills more.

390
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:09,057
For those who draw full illustrations,

391
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:11,187
you have to study

392
00:16:11,212 --> 00:16:13,336
how a certain artist composed the gaze

393
00:16:13,338 --> 00:16:16,046
and how a certain artist composed the canvas

394
00:16:16,048 --> 00:16:17,450
and so on.

395
00:16:17,452 --> 00:16:19,476
Try to be like them

396
00:16:19,501 --> 00:16:23,594
or try to go beyond that.

397
00:16:23,619 --> 00:16:24,984
If you keep practicing

398
00:16:24,986 --> 00:16:26,064
full illustration

399
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:27,923
you might be asked to draw loading illustrations,

400
00:16:28,267 --> 00:16:30,555
or draw illustrations for novels.

401
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,273
You could draw fan art to draw attention,

402
00:16:33,298 --> 00:16:35,969
or upload your work on Patreon.

403
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:39,134
I think it'll be a huge help when you do that.

404
00:16:39,869 --> 00:16:41,306
Portrait illustration.

405
00:16:41,331 --> 00:16:45,351
As expected, the standard is going up for this too.

406
00:16:45,376 --> 00:16:48,516
There are a lot of high quality illustrations coming out these days.

407
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,666
In the midst of all that, from the perspective of people who have to work,

408
00:16:51,691 --> 00:16:54,630
to the point where the students look pathetic,

409
00:16:54,655 --> 00:16:56,978
the overall quality of illustrations is high.

410
00:16:57,598 --> 00:16:59,789
In the past, you just needed to draw characters.

411
00:16:59,814 --> 00:17:01,906
If you could have just drawn a standing character,

412
00:17:01,907 --> 00:17:04,840
you could have found places

413
00:17:04,841 --> 00:17:06,141
to work.

414
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:08,439
But, these days, this isn't enough.

415
00:17:08,441 --> 00:17:09,977
These days, people who draw characters

416
00:17:10,002 --> 00:17:12,570
can even draw backgrounds.

417
00:17:12,595 --> 00:17:14,034
So, you should be able to draw backgrounds

418
00:17:14,036 --> 00:17:17,726
and draw simple objects as well.

419
00:17:17,751 --> 00:17:20,294
So, for those who draw full illustrations,

420
00:17:20,296 --> 00:17:22,273
this training will help.

421
00:17:22,298 --> 00:17:24,937
For those who draw portrait illustrations,

422
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:26,894
I'd like you to practice describing things

423
00:17:26,896 --> 00:17:28,274
like metal,

424
00:17:28,275 --> 00:17:29,728
trees,

425
00:17:30,087 --> 00:17:31,766
or simple objects

426
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,170
like cups and things like that.

427
00:17:33,697 --> 00:17:37,314
The ability to copy those things...

428
00:17:37,339 --> 00:17:39,293
I'm literally talking about the ability to copy.

429
00:17:39,318 --> 00:17:41,367
Spend about an hour or two

430
00:17:41,392 --> 00:17:44,541
to actually imitate objects.

431
00:17:44,566 --> 00:17:47,278
That's how you would train.

432
00:17:47,303 --> 00:17:50,064
If you can improve the level of perfection of your description,

433
00:17:50,089 --> 00:17:52,906
it will definitely help you draw better illustrations later on.

434
00:17:52,931 --> 00:17:55,297
Please continue to do those exercises.

435
00:17:55,322 --> 00:17:58,109
Of course, the composition of the canvas would be necessary.

436
00:17:58,134 --> 00:18:01,709
There's a limit to canvas composition, though.

437
00:18:01,711 --> 00:18:03,726
In the midst of such restrictions,

438
00:18:03,751 --> 00:18:06,736
it would be important to practice

439
00:18:06,761 --> 00:18:08,781
drawing beautiful illustrations in a stable way.

440
00:18:08,806 --> 00:18:10,570
For portrait illustration,

441
00:18:10,595 --> 00:18:12,161
compared to full illustrations,

442
00:18:12,163 --> 00:18:15,976
it requires a lot of perfection,

443
00:18:16,001 --> 00:18:20,289
so in a way, it's the kind of work that requires stability.

444
00:18:20,314 --> 00:18:24,219
Companies want illustrators who can draw high-quality work with stability,

445
00:18:24,244 --> 00:18:28,581
instead of more challenging work.

446
00:18:28,606 --> 00:18:30,017
So, I guess

447
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:32,899
it's good to compose a challenging canvas.

448
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,849
But composing a stable canvas,

449
00:18:34,851 --> 00:18:37,037
no matter how you compose the canvas,

450
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,180
there shouldn't be any imbalance when you look at it.

451
00:18:40,182 --> 00:18:41,929
You should make the gaze flow naturally.

452
00:18:41,931 --> 00:18:43,052
In other words, stability.

453
00:18:43,077 --> 00:18:46,777
I think it'll be good to practice with a sense of stability.

454
00:18:46,802 --> 00:18:49,425
That means you will work well in the end.

455
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:52,896
When it comes to being an illustrator,

456
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:56,113
I think there are two strengths.

457
00:18:56,138 --> 00:18:58,589
One is someone who draws well.

458
00:18:58,614 --> 00:19:01,621
And the second one is someone who draws stably.

459
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:04,114
They're both good at drawing but...

460
00:19:04,481 --> 00:19:08,168
In terms of sports, you can compare it to muscle strength and muscular endurance.

461
00:19:08,427 --> 00:19:13,121
There are people who have one or two popular artworks.

462
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:14,950
There are other people

463
00:19:14,952 --> 00:19:17,878
who aren't that popular,

464
00:19:17,903 --> 00:19:20,613
but who produce high-quality illustrations all the time.

465
00:19:20,638 --> 00:19:24,621
There's a difference between the two/

466
00:19:24,623 --> 00:19:28,016
For example, if you want to be hired by a company,

467
00:19:28,018 --> 00:19:29,298
or if you wish to be scouted,

468
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,954
you'll focus more on

469
00:19:30,956 --> 00:19:32,870
drawing stable illustrations.

470
00:19:32,895 --> 00:19:35,840
If you want to work as a freelance artist,

471
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,800
you can focus more on

472
00:19:38,825 --> 00:19:41,504
making one popular work.

473
00:19:42,786 --> 00:19:46,347
So, depending on what you want,

474
00:19:46,372 --> 00:19:49,372
you should practice things differently.

475
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:52,668
If you draw through this process,

476
00:19:53,301 --> 00:19:55,824
you'll be able to draw a picture of yourself.

477
00:19:55,849 --> 00:19:57,136
What I'm saying is

478
00:19:57,161 --> 00:20:00,143
if you practice with a certain skillset,

479
00:20:00,168 --> 00:20:02,192
you can think about

480
00:20:02,194 --> 00:20:05,270
how you can draw

481
00:20:05,272 --> 00:20:07,864
and what kind of impact will it give.

482
00:20:11,108 --> 00:20:14,661
For example, let's say your skills are here.

483
00:20:14,825 --> 00:20:17,548
Because you want to draw a full illustration,

484
00:20:17,595 --> 00:20:19,406
out of the things that are necessary for a full illustration,

485
00:20:19,431 --> 00:20:21,969
you have weaknesses

486
00:20:21,994 --> 00:20:25,485
in how to draw a charming character

487
00:20:25,486 --> 00:20:28,142
and the lighting and composition.

488
00:20:28,167 --> 00:20:29,691
Let's say your biggest weakness is composition.

489
00:20:29,716 --> 00:20:31,789
Then you need to learn that first.

490
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:34,200
What would be an effective way?

491
00:20:34,225 --> 00:20:37,708
It's most effective to analyze the screen composition while looking at the references.

492
00:20:37,733 --> 00:20:40,207
It'd be good to draw it from time to time, too.

493
00:20:40,232 --> 00:20:42,605
How long should you practice?

494
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,574
You should practice for a few months,

495
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:46,553
or for a few weeks.

496
00:20:46,555 --> 00:20:48,363
You might want to see the effects clearly

497
00:20:48,365 --> 00:20:50,356
and set your own plans.

498
00:20:50,974 --> 00:20:53,144
Actually, I'm sure that I've said

499
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:55,807
the most important thing is to learn how to study.

500
00:20:55,809 --> 00:20:57,574
I think I've said that before.

501
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:00,635
I wanted to include the process of perceiving illustrations

502
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,942
into this curriculum.

503
00:21:04,036 --> 00:21:06,657
You can improve your drawing skills later.

504
00:21:06,658 --> 00:21:08,707
You're going to improve your skills anyway.

505
00:21:08,732 --> 00:21:10,363
I can't improve it.

506
00:21:10,388 --> 00:21:14,074
I just distributed information to improve your skills.

507
00:21:14,099 --> 00:21:15,583
It's the responsibility of the students

508
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:16,957
to make it your own

509
00:21:16,982 --> 00:21:18,968
after you've collected the right information.

510
00:21:18,993 --> 00:21:22,276
It's one of your jobs as students.

511
00:21:22,278 --> 00:21:24,281
From now on, what you have to do is,

512
00:21:24,306 --> 00:21:26,921
when it comes to studying,

513
00:21:26,946 --> 00:21:28,446
make a plan.

514
00:21:29,446 --> 00:21:31,304
What do you need?

515
00:21:31,329 --> 00:21:33,207
To practice,

516
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:34,968
which method would be effective?

517
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:37,015
How long should you practice it

518
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,805
to get the effects you want?

519
00:21:39,001 --> 00:21:41,133
Let me tell you about this.

520
00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:42,594
This is something

521
00:21:42,619 --> 00:21:45,008
I commonly tell students.

522
00:21:45,815 --> 00:21:48,390
This is what studying is all about.

523
00:21:48,415 --> 00:21:50,422
The first thing is to find a problem.

524
00:21:51,499 --> 00:21:56,976
When focusing on concept art,

525
00:21:57,001 --> 00:22:00,015
since you haven't designed a lot, the design might look poor.

526
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,562
You might think you have much more weaknesses in fantasy design.

527
00:22:03,587 --> 00:22:07,280
Like this, you should identify what your downsides are

528
00:22:07,282 --> 00:22:10,351
with as much detail as possible.

529
00:22:10,376 --> 00:22:13,382
The first step is to select the details and make them into data.

530
00:22:13,407 --> 00:22:15,430
If you found the problem,

531
00:22:15,923 --> 00:22:17,557
look for the solution.

532
00:22:21,931 --> 00:22:23,702
I'm sure you can predict it to a certain extent.

533
00:22:23,727 --> 00:22:24,579
While listening to my class,

534
00:22:24,604 --> 00:22:27,624
you can use what you learned from it.

535
00:22:27,649 --> 00:22:30,984
For example, what's important when it comes to design?

536
00:22:31,009 --> 00:22:33,407
The silhouette arrangement of the entire design,

537
00:22:33,993 --> 00:22:35,399
and the ability to come up

538
00:22:36,693 --> 00:22:38,171
with concepts.

539
00:22:38,196 --> 00:22:47,804
And there's also the placement of dimensions, gaze, coloration and so on.

540
00:22:48,796 --> 00:22:50,965
Find the weakest one for you.

541
00:22:50,966 --> 00:22:52,825
To practice making concepts,

542
00:22:52,827 --> 00:22:55,131
you have to draw characters with various concepts.

543
00:22:55,156 --> 00:22:56,857
If you want to practice the silhouette,

544
00:22:56,882 --> 00:22:59,280
you need to draw many silhouettes.

545
00:22:59,367 --> 00:23:01,530
In that way, you need to find a solution.

546
00:23:02,085 --> 00:23:04,374
If you've done coloring, apply it.

547
00:23:04,521 --> 00:23:05,670
You need to try it right away.

548
00:23:05,695 --> 00:23:07,334
In the process of applying it,

549
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:10,249
it'll be good to think about how long you should do it.

550
00:23:10,453 --> 00:23:11,932
If you applied it,

551
00:23:11,934 --> 00:23:14,218
after that, give yourself some feedback.

552
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:18,419
If your design skills are weak,

553
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:20,193
especially with fantasy,

554
00:23:20,218 --> 00:23:24,503
and if it's hard to draw detailed equipment,

555
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:27,285
you should practice drawing them.

556
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,714
Look for things like fantasy armor

557
00:23:29,739 --> 00:23:32,753
and work on them for two weeks.

558
00:23:32,754 --> 00:23:33,840
Do one illustration a day.

559
00:23:34,778 --> 00:23:37,301
Use this to go into a real game.

560
00:23:37,303 --> 00:23:38,839
You need to actually design.

561
00:23:38,864 --> 00:23:41,582
When you have designed it, it will have gotten a bit better.

562
00:23:41,607 --> 00:23:43,574
It's a little better than before,

563
00:23:43,576 --> 00:23:45,699
but you will have some room for improvement.

564
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:48,325
Then, you would have solved about 30% of your problems.

565
00:23:49,067 --> 00:23:52,286
What should you do to make up for the remaining percentage?

566
00:23:53,247 --> 00:23:54,949
Say you've designed something curvy,

567
00:23:54,974 --> 00:23:57,050
so you would then go into designing something linear.

568
00:23:57,075 --> 00:23:59,221
Look for armor with a lot of lines.

569
00:24:00,169 --> 00:24:01,826
Or, you might think that

570
00:24:01,828 --> 00:24:04,003
you need to be able to draw leather clothes well.

571
00:24:04,028 --> 00:24:07,222
Then look for designs for leather clothes.

572
00:24:07,247 --> 00:24:10,047
Find a solution here,

573
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:10,848
and apply it.

574
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:13,097
The feedback process will become repetitive.

575
00:24:13,122 --> 00:24:14,910
This is what studying is all about.

576
00:24:14,935 --> 00:24:18,855
So this flow will help you

577
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,442
increase your drawing skills.

578
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:24,066
So, see if you're going well with the flow.

579
00:24:24,091 --> 00:24:25,105
Think about it well.

580
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,082
If you're not doing that,

581
00:24:27,107 --> 00:24:28,716
I hope you try it.

582
00:24:28,741 --> 00:24:30,544
I think you should try it.

583
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,591
I think it will definitely help.

584
00:24:33,911 --> 00:24:37,302
So, that's the summary of my curriculum.

585
00:24:37,303 --> 00:24:39,254
Using the basic skills of the human body,

586
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,683
once you understand the perspective, silhouette, and composition,

587
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:45,049
proceed with them purposefully.

588
00:24:46,474 --> 00:24:48,380
In the end, the ability that you want

589
00:24:48,405 --> 00:24:51,325
would be in drawing the way you want.

590
00:24:53,615 --> 00:24:55,719
In other words, through calculation,

591
00:24:55,721 --> 00:24:57,101
under thorough calculation,

592
00:24:57,103 --> 00:25:01,137
and as something extra, add your own sensitivity.

593
00:25:01,139 --> 00:25:06,172
I think our opinions go hand-in-hand

594
00:25:06,174 --> 00:25:07,324
with our illustrations.

595
00:25:07,349 --> 00:25:08,685
Under a thorough assessment,

596
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,110
you need to think about why you illustrated a certain area in that way.

597
00:25:10,135 --> 00:25:11,675
If you just put it in because you liked it,

598
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,725
or if there are one or two of these things,

599
00:25:13,726 --> 00:25:16,520
I think that will create a charming illustration.

600
00:25:16,661 --> 00:25:19,039
If you don't calculate at all and just go into those things,

601
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:20,957
it could still be a good illustration.

602
00:25:20,982 --> 00:25:23,582
But it would be very abstract.

603
00:25:23,607 --> 00:25:26,160
Sometimes, you can feel like the drawing is poor.

604
00:25:26,185 --> 00:25:29,013
It could feel less stable.

605
00:25:29,014 --> 00:25:32,044
Even so, if you calculate everything completely,

606
00:25:32,046 --> 00:25:33,722
the illustration would look too cold.

607
00:25:33,747 --> 00:25:36,222
It's stable when you look at it,

608
00:25:36,247 --> 00:25:38,491
but it won't be an exceptional illustration.

609
00:25:38,493 --> 00:25:40,372
As an illustrator,

610
00:25:40,374 --> 00:25:42,427
it might not be a good example.

611
00:25:42,575 --> 00:25:44,371
You can still work, but,

612
00:25:44,396 --> 00:25:47,579
there would be something missing

613
00:25:47,581 --> 00:25:51,817
when it comes to that illustration being a success.

614
00:25:51,997 --> 00:25:54,769
So it's good to think about what kind of illustrator you are.

615
00:25:54,794 --> 00:25:58,192
You may think your illustrations are stable.

616
00:25:58,194 --> 00:25:59,496
Or you may think you're more like an artist.

617
00:25:59,498 --> 00:26:01,132
Because you're an artist,

618
00:26:01,134 --> 00:26:03,137
you'll tend to draw in challenging ways.

619
00:26:03,521 --> 00:26:05,739
Think about what kind of illustrator you are,

620
00:26:05,982 --> 00:26:08,153
and if possible, please try to go for both.

621
00:26:09,271 --> 00:26:11,082
I've told you this before.

622
00:26:11,107 --> 00:26:16,270
The strengths and the weaknesses come together.

623
00:26:16,778 --> 00:26:18,575
If you have strengths,

624
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,825
there are weaknesses that come with it.

625
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:23,746
The person who draws a stable picture

626
00:26:23,771 --> 00:26:27,450
might not be able to draw a jackpot.

627
00:26:27,763 --> 00:26:29,973
If you're a sensitive person

628
00:26:29,975 --> 00:26:32,943
you might be weak at drawing with stability.

629
00:26:33,794 --> 00:26:36,921
Then you have to try to achieve the opposite

630
00:26:36,923 --> 00:26:39,575
and you need to be able to stabilize your strengths.

631
00:26:40,013 --> 00:26:43,606
Just because you have a weakness doesn't mean that it's not important.

632
00:26:43,608 --> 00:26:44,927
Your strengths are important, too.

633
00:26:45,099 --> 00:26:46,761
Even so, just because you have strengths,

634
00:26:46,786 --> 00:26:49,629
it's not like you can ignore your weaknesses.

635
00:26:49,654 --> 00:26:51,122
In the end,

636
00:26:51,341 --> 00:26:53,333
you need work on both.

637
00:26:53,771 --> 00:26:55,232
But you need to think about

638
00:26:55,257 --> 00:26:58,129
what to strengthen and what to practice.

639
00:26:58,154 --> 00:27:01,545
I'm sure there's some of you

640
00:27:01,872 --> 00:27:03,027
who aren't good at

641
00:27:03,052 --> 00:27:04,199
drawing sentimental pictures.

642
00:27:04,224 --> 00:27:10,031
I'm sure there are people who are drawing later in their life.

643
00:27:10,056 --> 00:27:14,984
Most of them are not familiar with the latest trends.

644
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:18,212
So there are people who want to know how to get familiarized with them.

645
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:19,898
What are the latest trends?

646
00:27:19,923 --> 00:27:21,520
There are also people

647
00:27:21,545 --> 00:27:22,961
who aren't sure what being pretty is all about.

648
00:27:22,986 --> 00:27:24,672
In that case, there's no choice.

649
00:27:24,697 --> 00:27:27,270
If there are things that we don't understand emotionally,

650
00:27:27,272 --> 00:27:28,556
you have to understand them with your brain.

651
00:27:29,877 --> 00:27:31,926
You have to be aware of the things that people like.

652
00:27:31,928 --> 00:27:34,218
Most people like this kind of stuff.

653
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,766
Why do people like these things?

654
00:27:35,791 --> 00:27:37,547
Think about it.

655
00:27:37,549 --> 00:27:40,558
You need to be able to continue to draw out the reasons for that.

656
00:27:40,923 --> 00:27:44,283
For example, let's say that recently, characters with small eyes

657
00:27:44,284 --> 00:27:46,844
are more popular than characters with big eyes.

658
00:27:46,869 --> 00:27:48,931
So these days,

659
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:53,406
a lot of characters have small eyes.

660
00:27:53,431 --> 00:27:54,423
The reason for that is,

661
00:27:54,448 --> 00:27:58,259
recently, when characters have eyes that are too big,

662
00:27:58,284 --> 00:28:00,562
people might find them awkward.

663
00:28:00,587 --> 00:28:02,289
But with smaller eyes,

664
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:04,877
illustrators pay more attention to the production,

665
00:28:04,879 --> 00:28:07,001
and describe the illustration in detail.

666
00:28:07,306 --> 00:28:10,687
So the overall quality looks better than it does in big-eyed illustrations.

667
00:28:10,712 --> 00:28:11,867
So, maybe because of that,

668
00:28:11,892 --> 00:28:12,856
the coloring quality

669
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:15,008
will be higher.

670
00:28:15,033 --> 00:28:16,728
You can analyze it like this.

671
00:28:17,494 --> 00:28:19,370
If there's something that you don't understand emotionally,

672
00:28:19,371 --> 00:28:19,934
you can't help but

673
00:28:19,936 --> 00:28:21,314
analyze it.

674
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,312
With the parts that you're weak in,

675
00:28:23,337 --> 00:28:25,242
you have to keep practicing like that.

676
00:28:25,267 --> 00:28:29,035
For example, you might not know why the frills on the skirt are pretty.

677
00:28:29,037 --> 00:28:30,359
Actually, I didn't, either.

678
00:28:30,384 --> 00:28:33,163
I didn't know why the frills on the skirt were so pretty.

679
00:28:33,188 --> 00:28:34,486
But if I were to draw frills right now,

680
00:28:34,511 --> 00:28:36,126
I can draw them in any way.

681
00:28:36,353 --> 00:28:38,650
I was able to draw this frill because,

682
00:28:38,652 --> 00:28:41,031
people like the frills on a skirt.

683
00:28:41,056 --> 00:28:45,394
It has a round silhouette

684
00:28:45,396 --> 00:28:48,106
so it looks pretty when it's layered.

685
00:28:48,131 --> 00:28:49,646
Understand it like that.

686
00:28:49,687 --> 00:28:51,514
And because I've utilized it,

687
00:28:51,515 --> 00:28:53,442
now I can draw frills like this.

688
00:28:53,467 --> 00:28:56,093
In the end, you're going to fix your weaknesses like this.

689
00:28:56,095 --> 00:28:59,200
And you'll increase your strengths.

690
00:28:59,225 --> 00:29:01,674
I think it's good to practice drawing.

691
00:29:01,676 --> 00:29:03,067
I said a lot of things.

692
00:29:03,092 --> 00:29:05,614
In the end, when it comes to studying drawing,

693
00:29:05,639 --> 00:29:10,624
you should be aware that you're studying,

694
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:12,849
and I hope that you feel

695
00:29:12,874 --> 00:29:14,912
that you are learning something from it.

696
00:29:15,475 --> 00:29:18,380
If you study drawing on your own,

697
00:29:18,405 --> 00:29:21,834
there are times when you feel like you're walking on a hopeless path.

698
00:29:22,014 --> 00:29:25,309
But your indicator would be

699
00:29:25,334 --> 00:29:27,651
the motive that you set as your destination.

700
00:29:27,653 --> 00:29:29,507
I told you about it before with the references.

701
00:29:29,509 --> 00:29:30,311
With references,

702
00:29:30,336 --> 00:29:32,692
if you have a motive,

703
00:29:32,717 --> 00:29:34,941
it's about getting closer to that motive.

704
00:29:34,966 --> 00:29:36,392
Acknowledge what you will need

705
00:29:36,394 --> 00:29:38,322
and make the sub elements for what you will need.

706
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,731
Clear through them one by one.

707
00:29:40,756 --> 00:29:42,813
It's important to feel fulfilled.

708
00:29:42,838 --> 00:29:44,850
It's a bit of a psychological thing, too.

709
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,544
People are not machines when it comes to studying drawing.

710
00:29:48,569 --> 00:29:50,217
What is studying after all?

711
00:29:50,219 --> 00:29:51,637
It's about strengthening your weaknesses.

712
00:29:51,639 --> 00:29:53,436
But it won't all be fun.

713
00:29:53,577 --> 00:29:55,521
People have fun at what they're good at.

714
00:29:55,523 --> 00:29:57,334
People are very tricky.

715
00:29:57,693 --> 00:29:59,196
People are tricky,

716
00:29:59,221 --> 00:30:01,326
so in the end, people like what they are good at.

717
00:30:01,819 --> 00:30:04,577
Then, it will be good to control that well.

718
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:07,788
You need to feel a sense of achievement.

719
00:30:09,471 --> 00:30:11,324
Goal-setting would be help you

720
00:30:11,349 --> 00:30:13,764
feel a sense of achievement.

721
00:30:13,789 --> 00:30:15,339
Keep looking for solutions

722
00:30:15,341 --> 00:30:16,850
and apply your knowledge.

723
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:18,918
It's important that you feel

724
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:21,305
that you're accomplishing more than before.

725
00:30:21,485 --> 00:30:23,850
Without that, you can't draw for a long time.

726
00:30:23,875 --> 00:30:28,202
If you just try extremely hard to go beyond your skill,

727
00:30:28,227 --> 00:30:30,053
you might make it there.

728
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:32,942
But other than those few people, it's going to be hard to hold out.

729
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:35,597
As such, when you work on illustrations,

730
00:30:35,622 --> 00:30:39,962
continue to make things that will give you a sense of accomplishment.

731
00:30:40,675 --> 00:30:43,524
So, I hope that you can feel

732
00:30:43,822 --> 00:30:45,761
that you're moving forward.

733
00:30:45,763 --> 00:30:47,032
From the perspective of studying,

734
00:30:48,744 --> 00:30:51,955
I hope this curriculum helps you

735
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:54,266
set those things up

736
00:30:54,291 --> 00:30:56,993
as you continue drawing.

737
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:59,539
The portrait illustration and full illustration

738
00:30:59,564 --> 00:31:01,523
that we made during class

739
00:31:01,548 --> 00:31:04,337
will be completed and uploaded later.

740
00:31:05,455 --> 00:31:07,062
I'm going to upload them,

741
00:31:07,087 --> 00:31:09,001
and students can work on these things.

742
00:31:09,026 --> 00:31:10,625
Upload them once in a while.

743
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,297
If there's a place to upload them to,

744
00:31:12,322 --> 00:31:13,319
do it.

745
00:31:13,321 --> 00:31:16,437
If you don't want to, you can just look at them yourself.

746
00:31:16,462 --> 00:31:18,254
Keep them as your own resource,

747
00:31:18,255 --> 00:31:19,416
and later on,

748
00:31:19,441 --> 00:31:21,915
you can look back at them when you have time.

749
00:31:22,384 --> 00:31:24,103
Do your best to draw.

750
00:31:24,525 --> 00:31:28,110
This is the end of my curriculum

751
00:31:28,111 --> 00:31:29,329
so I'll wrap it up here.

752
00:31:29,767 --> 00:31:31,315
Thank you for taking this class!

753
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:33,048
Keep up the great work.
