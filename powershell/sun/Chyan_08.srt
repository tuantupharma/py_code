00:00:05,966 --> 00:00:06,843
Hello.

3
00:00:06,868 --> 00:00:09,304
Today, we'll learn about the silhouette.

4
00:00:09,329 --> 00:00:12,718
Last time, we learned about the character's gaze.

5
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:15,754
I'll summarize the previous lecture.

6
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:17,175
When seeing an illustration,

7
00:00:17,218 --> 00:00:20,386
people's gaze moves in a certain direction.

8
00:00:20,411 --> 00:00:23,650
So, we can use that to our advantage

9
00:00:23,675 --> 00:00:26,364
to emphasize things we want to emphasize

10
00:00:26,389 --> 00:00:28,121
and make the gaze flow

11
00:00:28,146 --> 00:00:30,331
based on the mood we want to create.

12
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:33,663
When you're illustrating, that is very important.

13
00:00:33,688 --> 00:00:36,097
But, when you've just heard of the concept,

14
00:00:36,122 --> 00:00:39,058
you could ignore its importance.

15
00:00:39,267 --> 00:00:41,179
So, from now on,

16
00:00:41,204 --> 00:00:43,016
we have to know

17
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:45,216
how to utilize

18
00:00:45,241 --> 00:00:46,855
this gaze intentionally.

19
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,729
So, we'll learn about the silhouette today.

20
00:00:50,754 --> 00:00:54,932
As a basic concept, we learned about the gaze last time.

21
00:00:54,957 --> 00:00:57,393
Today, we'll go over

22
00:00:57,418 --> 00:01:00,310
how to utilize it to your full advantage.

23
00:01:00,312 --> 00:01:03,580
So, we will apply what we've learned to today's lecture.

24
00:01:03,582 --> 00:01:05,182
The three things that make up

25
00:01:05,207 --> 00:01:09,443
an illustration are the point, the line, and the plane.

26
00:01:09,468 --> 00:01:13,612
The silhouette would be related to the plane.

27
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:16,430
Among these three components,

28
00:01:16,455 --> 00:01:18,058
the point makes you focus.

29
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:20,277
The line induces you.

30
00:01:20,302 --> 00:01:23,208
And the plane decides the first impression.

31
00:01:23,233 --> 00:01:24,667
That's the summary.

32
00:01:24,692 --> 00:01:26,038
Simply put, for example,

33
00:01:26,063 --> 00:01:27,556
if there's a muscular character,

34
00:01:27,558 --> 00:01:29,472
the silhouette would be massive.

35
00:01:29,473 --> 00:01:31,307
And if you look at a muscular character,

36
00:01:31,332 --> 00:01:34,119
you can perceive the character

37
00:01:34,144 --> 00:01:35,712
as being aggressive.

38
00:01:35,714 --> 00:01:38,126
On the other hand, if the character's silhouette

39
00:01:38,128 --> 00:01:41,542
is gentle and slender,

40
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,650
you can perceive it as being

41
00:01:43,675 --> 00:01:44,989
a calm character.

42
00:01:44,991 --> 00:01:48,049
So, the silhouette has a huge impact

43
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:50,863
on deciding the character's first impression.

44
00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:54,350
Oh, the silhouette applies to the illustration stage.

45
00:01:54,351 --> 00:01:56,126
It applies to the design stage,

46
00:01:56,128 --> 00:01:59,134
and it also applies to the drawing stage.

47
00:01:59,136 --> 00:02:00,808
It always applies.

48
00:02:01,108 --> 00:02:02,833
Even when it's a simple hoodie,

49
00:02:02,858 --> 00:02:05,816
whether you draw it oversized

50
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:09,446
or whether you draw it tight

51
00:02:09,448 --> 00:02:11,589
that will differentiate the character's first impression.

52
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:14,726
So, the silhouette

53
00:02:14,728 --> 00:02:17,060
has a close relation with illustration.

54
00:02:17,085 --> 00:02:19,287
So, you should put your intentions towards it.

55
00:02:20,499 --> 00:02:25,031
I have the same character that I used

56
00:02:25,033 --> 00:02:27,227
when I explained about the gaze.

57
00:02:27,252 --> 00:02:28,870
Today, I'll use this character

58
00:02:28,895 --> 00:02:31,143
to show you its design.

59
00:02:31,145 --> 00:02:33,609
We're going to look at

60
00:02:33,848 --> 00:02:37,153
what kind of impressions a silhouette gives

61
00:02:37,155 --> 00:02:38,713
and how to use it effectively.

62
00:02:38,738 --> 00:02:41,096
So, why am I just showing you the design?

63
00:02:41,121 --> 00:02:42,466
Of course, like I told you before,

64
00:02:42,468 --> 00:02:45,206
you can use this silhouette in the composition.

65
00:02:45,527 --> 00:02:47,785
If a character is sitting down

66
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,290
and if its legs are

67
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,542
in an M shape like this,

68
00:02:52,753 --> 00:02:56,019
the overall silhouette of the character will be a triangular shape.

69
00:02:56,518 --> 00:02:58,665
So, it will look more stabilized.

70
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,186
Or, it could be lifting both arms up.

71
00:03:01,188 --> 00:03:04,268
So, when it's standing like this,

72
00:03:04,293 --> 00:03:05,649
the silhouette will be an inverted triangle.

73
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:07,252
So it would look energetic.

74
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,098
We can create different feelings like this.

75
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:11,316
But, I'll tell you about

76
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:15,422
the most common silhouettes

77
00:03:15,424 --> 00:03:16,794
later on.

78
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:20,026
There are many different kinds of silhouettes

79
00:03:20,051 --> 00:03:23,102
but, if we're just looking at the basic forms,

80
00:03:23,104 --> 00:03:25,261
these would be the basic ones.

81
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:28,230
First up, the triangle.

82
00:03:28,255 --> 00:03:29,588
I showed this in the previous example.

83
00:03:29,613 --> 00:03:34,175
With this silhouette, it has a lot of balance on the bottom

84
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,331
so, it looks kind of heavy.

85
00:03:36,356 --> 00:03:37,652
So, if a character has this silhouette,

86
00:03:37,677 --> 00:03:40,035
it gives off a calm impression.

87
00:03:43,793 --> 00:03:45,932
There would be a lot of elements at the bottom

88
00:03:45,957 --> 00:03:48,786
and fewer elements at the top.

89
00:03:49,022 --> 00:03:51,589
And, when it's flipped over,

90
00:03:51,591 --> 00:03:53,352
it would be an inverted triangle.

91
00:03:53,377 --> 00:03:56,668
This inverted triangle would be more energetic

92
00:03:56,693 --> 00:03:58,037
as opposed to being calm

93
00:03:59,136 --> 00:04:01,308
and it would look more impressive.

94
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,460
So, with cute characters, most of their elements

95
00:04:04,473 --> 00:04:06,777
would be at the top.

96
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,880
This character has a calm impression.

97
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:10,854
So its hair goes downwards.

98
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,351
If you want to draw a cute character,

99
00:04:13,376 --> 00:04:16,176
you can draw twin pigtails and make the hair go upwards.

100
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,325
And if it goes upwards,

101
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,362
it will look cuter

102
00:04:23,364 --> 00:04:25,417
than the previous silhouette.

103
00:04:26,222 --> 00:04:29,894
There are people who lift the pigtails completely like this.

104
00:04:30,065 --> 00:04:33,128
This is used for more dynamic compositions.

105
00:04:33,975 --> 00:04:36,213
So, a triangular composition is for calm images,

106
00:04:36,238 --> 00:04:39,449
and an inverted triangle is for energetic images.

107
00:04:39,883 --> 00:04:41,244
Now, this triangle is modified

108
00:04:41,269 --> 00:04:42,613
into this diamond shape.

109
00:04:42,638 --> 00:04:44,752
The diamond shape

110
00:04:44,777 --> 00:04:47,106
is used often

111
00:04:47,108 --> 00:04:49,735
for mobile game characters

112
00:04:49,737 --> 00:04:52,609
when we're drawing a portrait illustration.

113
00:04:52,634 --> 00:04:54,474
So, what is a diamond composition?

114
00:04:54,476 --> 00:04:57,441
Overall, the diamond composition strongly gives

115
00:04:57,957 --> 00:04:59,201
the appearance of a fancy composition.

116
00:04:59,203 --> 00:05:01,420
But, the difference between an inverted triangle,

117
00:05:01,422 --> 00:05:03,565
which is also dynamic and fancy,

118
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:06,257
is that it looks stabilized as well.

119
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:09,738
So, it has both the advantages of the two types of triangles.

120
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:12,118
With the diamond shape,

121
00:05:12,143 --> 00:05:14,396
the character would look fancy,

122
00:05:14,398 --> 00:05:17,456
and it's easier to make the viewers focus towards the center.

123
00:05:18,987 --> 00:05:21,235
If we look at where our eyes would be focused on,

124
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,860
with the triangle, it would be here,

125
00:05:24,885 --> 00:05:28,744
and with the inverted triangle, it would be here.

126
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:32,190
But actually, this spot changes

127
00:05:32,215 --> 00:05:34,378
quite fluidly.

128
00:05:34,403 --> 00:05:37,323
For example, when we have a triangular composition,

129
00:05:37,348 --> 00:05:38,615
the character's face would be here.

130
00:05:38,617 --> 00:05:40,851
The viewers would look at the face first,

131
00:05:40,853 --> 00:05:42,205
so their gaze would head here first.

132
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,433
So, the overall center of gravity

133
00:05:44,435 --> 00:05:47,205
should be at the bottom.

134
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,729
But, our eyes would look at the top.

135
00:05:49,754 --> 00:05:51,780
So, it's actually difficult to

136
00:05:51,782 --> 00:05:53,714
make the viewer's gaze focus on where we'd want them to.

137
00:05:54,322 --> 00:05:57,214
But, with this diamond shape,

138
00:05:57,988 --> 00:06:00,425
the center is definitely balanced.

139
00:06:00,427 --> 00:06:01,869
So, the viewers tend to

140
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:05,596
focus a lot on the elements in the middle.

141
00:06:05,621 --> 00:06:08,783
So, what're the characteristics of mobile games?

142
00:06:08,808 --> 00:06:11,711
Gamers have to know the character's charm at first glance.

143
00:06:11,713 --> 00:06:13,651
Also, the character needs to be very fancy.

144
00:06:13,676 --> 00:06:16,441
This way, gamers would want to get this character

145
00:06:16,466 --> 00:06:17,908
from a game's 'gacha' system.

146
00:06:17,933 --> 00:06:19,682
So, to do that,

147
00:06:19,707 --> 00:06:22,894
this diamond shape is used often

148
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:24,331
because it's more appropriate.

149
00:06:24,697 --> 00:06:26,479
There are other types, too.

150
00:06:26,504 --> 00:06:28,730
For example, there's the 8-shaped composition.

151
00:06:30,001 --> 00:06:31,556
Actually, this composition is simple.

152
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:35,449
With an 8-shaped composition, if there's a halo behind,

153
00:06:36,566 --> 00:06:39,010
people's gaze would focus strongly at the top.

154
00:06:39,035 --> 00:06:42,760
People would focus on the center of the circle.

155
00:06:42,785 --> 00:06:45,839
So, this character would look holy.

156
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,200
You might have seen this composition often

157
00:06:48,202 --> 00:06:50,640
when a goddess character

158
00:06:50,642 --> 00:06:52,394
has a halo behind her head.

159
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:54,839
If she also has a cape,

160
00:06:54,864 --> 00:06:56,385
like this,

161
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:00,183
the composition would overall look very holy.

162
00:07:01,238 --> 00:07:07,346
Other than the triangle, the diamond, and the 8-shape,

163
00:07:07,348 --> 00:07:11,043
there could be triangular compositions that are heavy on one side.

164
00:07:11,068 --> 00:07:15,165
There could be trapezoid shapes, and other shapes too.

165
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,428
But, the compositions that decide

166
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,853
the overall image would be just the ones we learned.

167
00:07:20,159 --> 00:07:24,037
So, I'll apply our knowledge to the gaze here.

168
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:27,127
The gaze focuses on the bottom,

169
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:29,306
so it overall gives a calm impression.

170
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:32,259
When the gaze focuses on the top,

171
00:07:32,284 --> 00:07:34,533
it looks energetic overall.

172
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:38,923
The gaze spreads out.

173
00:07:39,276 --> 00:07:40,817
The horizontal lines are long

174
00:07:40,842 --> 00:07:42,361
and our eyes focus on the center.

175
00:07:42,386 --> 00:07:46,395
So, it would be often used for

176
00:07:46,397 --> 00:07:47,721
fancy portrait illustrations.

177
00:07:48,596 --> 00:07:51,803
The gaze spins once around the head.

178
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:54,943
Either from above it, or from behind it.

179
00:07:54,945 --> 00:07:57,324
The gaze would draw a big circle.

180
00:07:57,326 --> 00:07:59,677
Because we focus on the character's face,

181
00:07:59,702 --> 00:08:01,645
it looks holy.

182
00:08:02,062 --> 00:08:04,239
Now, if you use this knowledge,

183
00:08:04,264 --> 00:08:06,373
you can effectively use silhouettes

184
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,957
according to your intentions.

185
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,330
So, you should remember this.

186
00:08:11,332 --> 00:08:13,133
Remember these four types of silhouettes

187
00:08:13,135 --> 00:08:15,228
and apply them to your illustrations.

188
00:08:15,253 --> 00:08:18,809
We went over the overall first impression of the silhouette.

189
00:08:18,834 --> 00:08:22,342
So, from here, we can decide the second impression.

190
00:08:26,808 --> 00:08:28,108
The first impression

191
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,997
is decided by the overall silhouette.

192
00:08:31,022 --> 00:08:33,562
The second impression is decided by a lesser factor,

193
00:08:33,563 --> 00:08:35,349
which would be the lines.

194
00:08:35,562 --> 00:08:38,709
The lines decide the character's second impression.

195
00:08:39,514 --> 00:08:40,627
What am I talking about?

196
00:08:40,628 --> 00:08:44,529
How would you feel if a silhouette was round?

197
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,083
It would be a cute character.

198
00:08:48,108 --> 00:08:51,342
On the other hand, if the silhouette is pointed,

199
00:08:52,287 --> 00:08:54,756
it will look aggressive.

200
00:08:55,065 --> 00:08:58,279
If the overall silhouette has a lot of curves

201
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,599
that move smoothly,

202
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:04,006
it will look luxurious.

203
00:09:04,615 --> 00:09:07,662
If the silhouette is a square shape,

204
00:09:08,085 --> 00:09:12,326
it will look defensive and firm.

205
00:09:12,936 --> 00:09:15,593
If we maintain this triangular composition,

206
00:09:15,594 --> 00:09:18,178
and if we draw the lines inwards,

207
00:09:18,217 --> 00:09:19,903
it would look weaker.

208
00:09:19,928 --> 00:09:24,468
If it's a triangle with round lines that go outwards,

209
00:09:24,469 --> 00:09:26,053
we can alter it

210
00:09:26,319 --> 00:09:28,376
so that it looks cute.

211
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,503
So, by utilizing these four basic compositions,

212
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,365
and by using the lines below,

213
00:09:33,617 --> 00:09:36,912
we would actually draw while fixing the silhouettes.

214
00:09:37,862 --> 00:09:39,850
So, let's get to it.

215
00:09:40,232 --> 00:09:44,240
Let's decorate and design this character.

216
00:09:48,873 --> 00:09:53,037
First off, we'll use the triangular composition.

217
00:09:53,062 --> 00:09:55,306
Because it gives off a calm impression,

218
00:09:55,308 --> 00:09:56,930
from these two examples,

219
00:09:56,931 --> 00:10:00,309
I'll use this less energetic silhouette.

220
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:03,104
I'll also add in curves overall

221
00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:05,093
so that it looks classy.

222
00:10:05,094 --> 00:10:09,463
So, this character would be calm, dull, and classy.

223
00:10:09,464 --> 00:10:11,953
These are the impressions we want to give.

224
00:10:12,937 --> 00:10:14,789
I'll draw the clothes.

225
00:10:47,395 --> 00:10:50,764
I'll make the clothes curve more inwards around the waist

226
00:10:50,766 --> 00:10:53,288
so that the waist would be thin.

227
00:10:59,894 --> 00:11:03,292
The bottom silhouette

228
00:11:03,317 --> 00:11:05,953
should also be forming a triangular shape as much as possible.

229
00:11:07,544 --> 00:11:08,660
Like I told you before,

230
00:11:08,685 --> 00:11:11,445
there should be a lot of elements on the bottom.

231
00:11:12,983 --> 00:11:16,585
So, let's say this character is a wizard.

232
00:11:17,186 --> 00:11:18,772
An ice wizard.

233
00:11:19,024 --> 00:11:20,246
Or,

234
00:11:23,961 --> 00:11:26,148
let's just say it's a plant wizard.

235
00:11:26,173 --> 00:11:28,116
I think that would be better to

236
00:11:28,141 --> 00:11:29,629
show the curves of the character.

237
00:11:29,654 --> 00:11:31,680
If it's a plant wizard,

238
00:11:31,681 --> 00:11:34,225
most of its magic effects

239
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,418
would be placed downwards.

240
00:11:41,871 --> 00:11:44,367
First, I'll draw the clothes.

241
00:11:50,007 --> 00:11:52,983
Some of you may find it difficult to design a character.

242
00:11:53,008 --> 00:11:55,569
You might think it's challenging.

243
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:58,674
You may even wonder if you can start designing with your current skills.

244
00:11:58,699 --> 00:12:01,043
Drawing fan art could feel more comfortable for now.

245
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:04,619
But, if you do practical work later,

246
00:12:04,621 --> 00:12:07,812
you'll have to design most of your works.

247
00:12:07,837 --> 00:12:09,708
If you are just going to draw as a hobby

248
00:12:09,733 --> 00:12:12,761
or just draw fan art, it'll be fine.

249
00:12:12,786 --> 00:12:15,803
But other than that, you need some design skills.

250
00:12:16,017 --> 00:12:18,024
If you work with subcontracts,

251
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:20,922
there are concept artworks where you would just work on design.

252
00:12:21,218 --> 00:12:24,583
You could also draw the concept art and the illustration.

253
00:12:24,608 --> 00:12:26,929
This type of work is the most common these days.

254
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:29,788
Other than that, you might draw loading illustrations.

255
00:12:30,289 --> 00:12:32,272
Or you may also have to design the cover for books.

256
00:12:32,297 --> 00:12:34,612
So, if you're not drawing

257
00:12:34,613 --> 00:12:36,701
a loading illustration

258
00:12:36,726 --> 00:12:37,695
or selling your fan artwork,

259
00:12:37,697 --> 00:12:39,881
most of the time, you would have to do design work.

260
00:12:39,906 --> 00:12:41,983
So, practicing design is important.

261
00:12:42,106 --> 00:12:45,835
You might think design is something difficult.

262
00:12:45,837 --> 00:12:48,337
But, when you draw the silhouette just like your intention,

263
00:12:48,362 --> 00:12:50,352
like I did now,

264
00:12:51,797 --> 00:12:54,256
even if the specific elements within it changes,

265
00:12:54,281 --> 00:12:56,108
as long as the overall silhouette stays the same,

266
00:12:56,133 --> 00:12:58,723
you can express what you wanted to

267
00:12:58,724 --> 00:13:00,023
in the overall image.

268
00:13:00,586 --> 00:13:04,404
After that, you would just make it look prettier.

269
00:13:04,406 --> 00:13:06,820
So, you would keep looking at references.

270
00:13:07,962 --> 00:13:09,703
If you just get the first impression right,

271
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,020
most of the time

272
00:13:13,021 --> 00:13:14,873
you can draw the image you want.

273
00:13:14,898 --> 00:13:16,696
So, don't worry about it too much.

274
00:13:16,698 --> 00:13:18,201
I recommend you to practice drawing

275
00:13:18,203 --> 00:13:20,330
while thinking of today's topic

276
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,088
and thinking of how to

277
00:13:23,022 --> 00:13:26,102
move a gaze according to your intention.

278
00:13:26,644 --> 00:13:28,936
There will be some of you

279
00:13:28,961 --> 00:13:31,729
who want to draw game illustrations

280
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,069
but who have never designed.

281
00:13:33,094 --> 00:13:37,055
If that's you, I strongly suggest

282
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,937
practicing design in your free time.

283
00:13:42,433 --> 00:13:44,959
When I previously mentioned the point, line, and plane,

284
00:13:44,984 --> 00:13:47,834
I mentioned that the line directs the gaze.

285
00:13:47,859 --> 00:13:49,389
In other words, it would induce you.

286
00:13:49,414 --> 00:13:50,780
Then, you can use the lines to

287
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:52,690
make the viewers focus on a certain point.

288
00:13:52,692 --> 00:13:54,650
Let's say you want a triangular shape.

289
00:13:54,651 --> 00:13:56,398
It would be the most effective to

290
00:13:56,423 --> 00:13:58,382
make the clothing go inwards, then outwards.

291
00:13:58,777 --> 00:14:01,632
If it goes outwards from here, the gaze would head in the opposite direction.

292
00:14:02,161 --> 00:14:04,624
So, to make the gaze move in the way you want,

293
00:14:05,213 --> 00:14:08,452
you can place metals next to the breasts, like this.

294
00:14:08,477 --> 00:14:10,023
Make them go inwards first,

295
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,148
then make them go outwards.

296
00:14:16,085 --> 00:14:18,917
See how the elements related to the line

297
00:14:19,224 --> 00:14:23,054
make the gaze move in the direction I want?

298
00:14:24,465 --> 00:14:26,680
We also need focal points in the center.

299
00:14:26,705 --> 00:14:28,281
In other words, elements related to the dot.

300
00:14:28,306 --> 00:14:30,097
Previously, when we learned about the gaze,

301
00:14:30,122 --> 00:14:32,449
we learned a good element in illustration

302
00:14:32,474 --> 00:14:34,678
would make the gaze flow naturally.

303
00:14:34,703 --> 00:14:37,725
We would also need focal points.

304
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,029
So, if we place these focal points

305
00:14:40,054 --> 00:14:44,246
with detailed patterns in these areas,

306
00:14:45,393 --> 00:14:51,309
it would be a better design.

307
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:58,823
One of the most widely used designs in practical work

308
00:14:58,824 --> 00:15:01,004
is this triangular design.

309
00:15:02,212 --> 00:15:02,884
Like this one.

310
00:15:02,886 --> 00:15:05,284
I sometimes call it the arrow.

311
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:07,431
If the bottom lines are longer

312
00:15:07,433 --> 00:15:10,176
and if the upper lines are shorter, the gaze would

313
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,028
naturally flow in this direction.

314
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:14,791
So, this acts as an arrow.

315
00:15:14,816 --> 00:15:16,059
It becomes a guidepost.

316
00:15:16,192 --> 00:15:18,919
So, you can add in elements like this

317
00:15:18,944 --> 00:15:21,207
to make the gaze go towards your intentions.

318
00:15:22,104 --> 00:15:23,127
This element would

319
00:15:23,152 --> 00:15:25,660
make sure the gaze goes downwards.

320
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:31,584
If you want to add in visual elements,

321
00:15:31,609 --> 00:15:33,707
it's effective to use colors.

322
00:15:36,918 --> 00:15:40,405
It would be really good to use colors

323
00:15:40,703 --> 00:15:42,730
around the important areas.

324
00:15:49,028 --> 00:15:52,081
So, we now used flows that go downwards.

325
00:15:52,106 --> 00:15:56,277
And we decided that the character uses plant magic.

326
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:59,218
Let's set the overall color.

327
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:06,105
I'll set the overall color to green.

328
00:16:06,787 --> 00:16:09,483
Now, I'll draw the plants.

329
00:16:09,528 --> 00:16:13,098
When you draw plants, remember that they are curved overall.

330
00:16:13,123 --> 00:16:15,483
So, these elements will be very appropriate

331
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:17,598
to give the impression we want.

332
00:16:17,981 --> 00:16:20,284
We have to twist the plants as much as possible.

333
00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:22,058
We also need to create a triangular silhouette.

334
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,723
So, I'll place them at the bottom.

335
00:16:32,504 --> 00:16:34,499
While maintaining a triangular silhouette,

336
00:16:34,524 --> 00:16:36,387
the tree trunks would be placed here.

337
00:16:37,168 --> 00:16:40,470
Remember, you need to make sure that the trunks

338
00:16:40,472 --> 00:16:41,520
aren't placed too regularly.

339
00:16:41,524 --> 00:16:45,128
Remember when we divided the hair into dimensions?

340
00:16:45,153 --> 00:16:48,973
Like that, we're going to use irregular patterns

341
00:16:48,998 --> 00:16:50,551
and create irregularity and draw.

342
00:17:03,325 --> 00:17:06,964
So, if we place a lot of elements at the bottom,

343
00:17:06,989 --> 00:17:11,167
the overall impression will be calm.

344
00:17:11,192 --> 00:17:12,669
But, you may wonder

345
00:17:12,671 --> 00:17:15,209
if you can add in other types

346
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:16,426
of silhouettes.

347
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:17,777
It's actually possible.

348
00:17:17,802 --> 00:17:19,863
But, in this case, it's nearly impossible to

349
00:17:20,716 --> 00:17:23,910
add an inverted triangular silhouette.

350
00:17:23,935 --> 00:17:25,935
Because it would collide with what we've done.

351
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,800
But, it's possible to

352
00:17:27,825 --> 00:17:29,422
add in a small diamond silhouette

353
00:17:29,447 --> 00:17:31,616
or an 8-shaped composition.

354
00:17:31,648 --> 00:17:33,639
There are a lot of different diamonds.

355
00:17:33,664 --> 00:17:35,208
There could be an exact diamond like this,

356
00:17:35,233 --> 00:17:37,414
and there could be a diamond that's longer at the bottom.

357
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,769
There are also diamonds that're longer at the top.

358
00:17:39,794 --> 00:17:41,598
There are also diamonds with longer sides.

359
00:17:41,713 --> 00:17:43,542
We looked at the different types of diamonds,

360
00:17:43,567 --> 00:17:46,053
so, we can now mix them.

361
00:17:46,078 --> 00:17:48,767
For example, this character uses tree power.

362
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:50,643
You may think that because it uses tree power,

363
00:17:50,645 --> 00:17:51,824
you want it to look holy,

364
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:54,519
just like a goddess.

365
00:17:55,801 --> 00:17:57,412
How would we do that?

366
00:17:57,414 --> 00:18:00,324
Remember it's good to add a silhouette behind the head?

367
00:18:01,963 --> 00:18:04,137
So, I'll draw a trunk like this.

368
00:18:08,392 --> 00:18:11,434
You'll see that the impression changed suddenly.

369
00:18:11,459 --> 00:18:14,515
The character has different impressions

370
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,535
depending on whether it has this trunk or not.

371
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:22,613
I'll add horns to the character for better focus.

372
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:30,449
So, silhouettes and gazes are all about

373
00:18:30,451 --> 00:18:33,378
designing an illustration based on

374
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,290
the mood you want to create.

375
00:18:35,292 --> 00:18:37,925
So, these two elements

376
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,689
would be the key elements to address

377
00:18:41,691 --> 00:18:44,426
if you want to be an illustrator.

378
00:18:44,908 --> 00:18:46,972
Drawing a character beautifully

379
00:18:46,997 --> 00:18:48,722
and having a gorgeous drawing style

380
00:18:48,747 --> 00:18:51,643
are actually just additional elements.

381
00:18:51,668 --> 00:18:53,512
That's what I think.

382
00:18:53,537 --> 00:18:56,367
Of course, in commercial art, your drawing style is very important.

383
00:18:56,392 --> 00:18:58,256
You need to have a charming drawing style.

384
00:18:58,258 --> 00:19:00,698
Also, you shouldn't be lazy in

385
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,159
experimenting with it.

386
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:05,673
But, before that, you need to understand how to

387
00:19:05,675 --> 00:19:06,893
compose your illustration.

388
00:19:06,918 --> 00:19:09,742
I think this is the biggest element

389
00:19:09,744 --> 00:19:12,050
that can affect your growth as an artist.

390
00:19:12,075 --> 00:19:14,103
You may think that you have to

391
00:19:14,105 --> 00:19:15,139
study this part separately.

392
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,565
You may think that you always need to have your intentions.

393
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,089
That isn't true.

394
00:19:19,114 --> 00:19:20,851
If you keep studying,

395
00:19:20,853 --> 00:19:22,413
if you keep drawing,

396
00:19:22,438 --> 00:19:25,760
if you continue drawing, even if you're ignorant,

397
00:19:25,785 --> 00:19:29,410
someday, you'll learn these parts just by doing it.

398
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:30,389
You'll get a hunch.

399
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:33,073
If you just draw, you can make a good silhouette.

400
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:35,144
But you'd have to

401
00:19:35,169 --> 00:19:37,449
draw a lot. Really a lot.

402
00:19:37,787 --> 00:19:41,226
For about three to four years.

403
00:19:41,251 --> 00:19:43,200
You have to draw at least that long

404
00:19:43,202 --> 00:19:45,184
to grasp the basic concepts.

405
00:19:45,346 --> 00:19:48,179
But, you're not here to do that, right?

406
00:19:48,204 --> 00:19:49,793
When you're seeing this video,

407
00:19:49,818 --> 00:19:51,444
you should focus on

408
00:19:51,446 --> 00:19:54,524
intentionally using

409
00:19:54,525 --> 00:19:56,281
gazes and silhouettes.

410
00:19:56,989 --> 00:19:59,164
You should use them intentionally

411
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,295
to grasp these concepts with your head

412
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,902
instead of grasping them with muscle memory.

413
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:04,181
This is something

414
00:20:04,183 --> 00:20:06,527
I emphasize to my students.

415
00:20:07,254 --> 00:20:08,815
Actually, muscle memory is the best.

416
00:20:08,817 --> 00:20:10,018
If you have good muscle memory,

417
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:11,056
that would mean you were talented

418
00:20:11,081 --> 00:20:13,143
from the beginning.

419
00:20:13,168 --> 00:20:15,241
But that might not always work.

420
00:20:15,243 --> 00:20:17,676
For instance, each person has

421
00:20:17,678 --> 00:20:20,121
their own strengths.

422
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,730
There are people who like drawing calm illustrations.

423
00:20:23,478 --> 00:20:26,533
There are others who are good at drawing dynamic illustrations.

424
00:20:26,674 --> 00:20:28,531
Others are good at drawing cute illustrations.

425
00:20:28,556 --> 00:20:34,691
So, everyone has their own strengths.

426
00:20:36,327 --> 00:20:37,872
But, that would mean,

427
00:20:37,874 --> 00:20:41,731
people usually can't draw something that's opposite to their strengths.

428
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:43,580
For example, if you can draw calm characters well,

429
00:20:43,581 --> 00:20:45,066
your weakness would be cute characters.

430
00:20:45,395 --> 00:20:47,903
It would also apply

431
00:20:47,905 --> 00:20:49,699
to the opposite situation.

432
00:20:50,366 --> 00:20:53,043
But, it's actually clear why those are your weaknesses.

433
00:20:53,451 --> 00:20:57,215
It's because you don't have muscle memory.

434
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,972
So, when someone is good at

435
00:21:00,974 --> 00:21:03,042
drawing cute characters thanks to muscle memory,

436
00:21:03,043 --> 00:21:05,460
if they rely on it too much with calm characters,

437
00:21:05,462 --> 00:21:07,418
the character would end up looking cute.

438
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,248
So, in a lot of cases,

439
00:21:09,574 --> 00:21:12,085
you wouldn't be able to follow your intentions.

440
00:21:12,087 --> 00:21:14,051
In order to minimize these situations,

441
00:21:14,053 --> 00:21:16,926
I'll tell you all about how to use your intentions.

442
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:19,207
If you focused on cute characters

443
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,275
so far,

444
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,129
practice drawing calm characters,

445
00:21:22,154 --> 00:21:24,191
and make the silhouette in a triangular shape.

446
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:26,211
Make sure the viewer's gaze goes downwards,

447
00:21:26,236 --> 00:21:27,902
and work on your illustration.

448
00:21:27,927 --> 00:21:30,824
After you're done, compare it to your previous drawings of

449
00:21:30,849 --> 00:21:32,291
calm characters.

450
00:21:32,316 --> 00:21:34,543
Did your character actually appear calm?

451
00:21:34,568 --> 00:21:37,598
If it did, today's lecture

452
00:21:37,623 --> 00:21:39,637
will have been a success.

453
00:21:42,396 --> 00:21:44,207
That's all I want to tell you.

454
00:21:51,775 --> 00:21:54,363
The illustrations on the right look like an elemental table, right?

455
00:21:54,894 --> 00:21:57,488
Well, it's kind of like that.

456
00:21:57,513 --> 00:22:00,027
It's kind of like an elemental table.

457
00:22:00,795 --> 00:22:03,195
These would be our tools to help us

458
00:22:03,394 --> 00:22:04,996
express a character.

459
00:22:05,269 --> 00:22:07,987
So, first, we worked on a character

460
00:22:08,012 --> 00:22:10,207
that looks calm and holy.

461
00:22:19,192 --> 00:22:23,309
We'll work on the same character again, but,

462
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,762
we're going to use an inverted triangle and a pointy silhouette

463
00:22:26,787 --> 00:22:29,629
to make it look aggressive.

464
00:22:29,654 --> 00:22:32,527
You'd usually do this when you're drawing armor.

465
00:22:45,633 --> 00:22:49,381
If you're an avid fan of RPG games,

466
00:22:49,406 --> 00:22:51,410
you would have seen this silhouette often.

467
00:22:52,876 --> 00:22:55,629
Because high-level weapons need be threatening,

468
00:22:56,181 --> 00:22:58,277
characters who use those weapons

469
00:22:58,302 --> 00:23:00,512
or characters who are the enemy

470
00:23:00,537 --> 00:23:01,723
tend to have pointy silhouettes.

471
00:23:03,775 --> 00:23:06,539
But, it doesn't necessarily have to be armor.

472
00:23:06,564 --> 00:23:09,246
Even if it's a hoodie, if you draw it pointy,

473
00:23:09,271 --> 00:23:10,941
you can make it look aggressive.

474
00:23:10,966 --> 00:23:13,047
Today, I want to show you dramatic differences,

475
00:23:13,072 --> 00:23:14,961
so I'm drawing some armor today.

476
00:23:15,105 --> 00:23:17,533
But, later, when you're actually drawing,

477
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,388
make those changes to a simple hoodie.

478
00:23:20,413 --> 00:23:21,723
A sharp hoodie,

479
00:23:21,748 --> 00:23:22,863
and a soft hoodie.

480
00:23:22,888 --> 00:23:26,469
Just by drawing different types of creases

481
00:23:26,494 --> 00:23:28,848
you can change the character's impression.

482
00:23:34,089 --> 00:23:36,644
We need to make sure the gaze heads upwards.

483
00:23:36,867 --> 00:23:39,988
If you control the silhouette like this, the middle will be empty.

484
00:23:40,013 --> 00:23:42,312
So, if we follow this black area,

485
00:23:42,313 --> 00:23:44,301
it will turn around at the upper body area.

486
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,854
Because our gaze would draw a circle at the upper body,

487
00:23:46,856 --> 00:23:48,973
our gaze would be focusing there.

488
00:24:08,121 --> 00:24:09,871
The silhouette at the bottom

489
00:24:11,498 --> 00:24:13,543
needs to be as simple as possible.

490
00:24:35,782 --> 00:24:39,148
We need to add more details to the top.

491
00:24:39,602 --> 00:24:40,738
Let's draw horns

492
00:24:46,174 --> 00:24:48,199
to make the silhouette pointy.

493
00:25:09,767 --> 00:25:12,566
Because our gaze should be headed upwards,

494
00:25:12,591 --> 00:25:15,426
in the middle area, our gaze shouldn't go sideways.

495
00:25:16,069 --> 00:25:18,160
It would be better if our gaze focuses at the middle.

496
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,160
This way, we would get an inverted triangle shape.

497
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:36,297
To make the silhouette a strong inverted triangle,

498
00:25:38,914 --> 00:25:40,941
we're going to make the gaze go up.

499
00:25:51,604 --> 00:25:53,574
Let's utilize the hair.

500
00:25:54,004 --> 00:25:56,441
Previously, the hair sank downwards

501
00:25:56,466 --> 00:25:58,309
so it gave off a calm impression.

502
00:25:58,674 --> 00:26:01,051
So, let's modify the hair a bit

503
00:26:09,879 --> 00:26:11,101
and make pointed hair

504
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:13,434
that goes upwards.

505
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:29,418
And if we modify

506
00:26:50,313 --> 00:26:51,725
the facial expression,

507
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:54,901
we'll end up with a character

508
00:26:54,903 --> 00:26:56,809
with an aggressive look.

509
00:27:02,021 --> 00:27:05,171
As you can see, the silhouette is important

510
00:27:05,196 --> 00:27:06,863
when it comes to describing a character.

511
00:27:06,888 --> 00:27:09,285
The same applies to weapons.

512
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:11,801
If you want the character

513
00:27:11,826 --> 00:27:13,882
to look even more aggressive and hostile,

514
00:27:13,907 --> 00:27:16,746
place the weapons on top.

515
00:27:16,771 --> 00:27:19,555
But, if you want the character to look heavy

516
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:22,129
and if you want to use complex compositions

517
00:27:22,154 --> 00:27:23,620
by giving a heavy impression

518
00:27:23,645 --> 00:27:25,438
and a sharp impression at the same time,

519
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,246
you can place more elements

520
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:28,934
at the bottom.

521
00:27:28,959 --> 00:27:31,488
If you give an axe to this character,

522
00:27:31,513 --> 00:27:34,465
it will look aggressive like before.

523
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:36,511
Also, because it has more elements at the bottom,

524
00:27:36,536 --> 00:27:39,949
it will look more stable.

525
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:44,328
So, we now have a character that looks

526
00:27:44,353 --> 00:27:45,793
a lot different from the previous one.

527
00:27:45,818 --> 00:27:48,199
You can clearly see that the character

528
00:27:48,224 --> 00:27:50,366
will be

529
00:27:50,383 --> 00:27:51,887
very aggressive.

530
00:27:51,912 --> 00:27:54,715
If you want to emphasize its aggressiveness,

531
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,715
make sure you put more elements at the top.

532
00:27:58,017 --> 00:28:00,002
Then, the gaze would go up,

533
00:28:00,027 --> 00:28:01,738
and you can emphasize the aggressiveness.

534
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:04,746
I'll tell you another method.

535
00:28:04,771 --> 00:28:06,854
If you want to use methods

536
00:28:06,879 --> 00:28:09,074
other than designing the character,

537
00:28:09,258 --> 00:28:10,879
you can lift its arm like this.

538
00:28:12,353 --> 00:28:14,110
You know how aggressive characters

539
00:28:14,111 --> 00:28:16,038
sometimes make a cringey pose?

540
00:28:16,063 --> 00:28:18,466
For example, they would make a pose

541
00:28:18,491 --> 00:28:20,551
where it looks like they're grasping something at the top.

542
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,423
Well, in the end, the purpose is the same.

543
00:28:23,448 --> 00:28:25,642
Because its poses would be cringey

544
00:28:25,667 --> 00:28:28,121
and aggressive at the same time,

545
00:28:28,146 --> 00:28:30,787
to emphasize that, we can lift its arms up

546
00:28:30,812 --> 00:28:33,012
and add more elements at the top.

547
00:28:33,037 --> 00:28:34,051
Like this.

548
00:28:36,802 --> 00:28:39,519
This fire can be a supplementary element.

549
00:28:39,915 --> 00:28:42,801
So, the more elements there are at the top,

550
00:28:42,826 --> 00:28:45,426
the more the character would look aggressive.

551
00:28:46,288 --> 00:28:48,738
That was the second example.

552
00:29:17,008 --> 00:29:19,605
Let's add another example.

553
00:29:19,964 --> 00:29:23,316
I'm going to draw a cute character now.

554
00:29:27,941 --> 00:29:30,735
I'll keep on working with the same character.

555
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:34,546
If you want a cute atmosphere, what kind of silhouette

556
00:29:34,567 --> 00:29:36,394
should you use?

557
00:29:36,755 --> 00:29:39,557
Well, we can't say a calm character

558
00:29:39,582 --> 00:29:42,222
looks cute.

559
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:44,145
We could say that it looks pretty.

560
00:29:44,147 --> 00:29:46,153
So, for the upper body part,

561
00:29:46,178 --> 00:29:49,316
we'll create an inverted triangle and a diamond silhouette.

562
00:29:50,143 --> 00:29:51,954
I'll use these compositions.

563
00:29:51,967 --> 00:29:54,113
And, if you want the silhouette

564
00:29:54,133 --> 00:29:55,613
to look cute,

565
00:29:55,615 --> 00:29:57,480
you can use a round silhouette.

566
00:29:57,505 --> 00:29:59,926
So, I'll utilize this round silhouette.

567
00:29:59,951 --> 00:30:01,643
What should you avoid?

568
00:30:01,668 --> 00:30:03,050
If you give it a calm atmosphere

569
00:30:03,075 --> 00:30:04,321
along with an 8-shaped composition,

570
00:30:04,346 --> 00:30:05,724
it will look holy.

571
00:30:05,749 --> 00:30:07,440
You should avoid these

572
00:30:07,465 --> 00:30:09,642
to make it look cute.

573
00:30:09,667 --> 00:30:12,330
So, now that we decided what we should avoid,

574
00:30:12,355 --> 00:30:15,196
let's utilize that and design this character.

575
00:30:19,267 --> 00:30:22,062
Remember how I said a round silhouette would be appropriate?

576
00:30:22,067 --> 00:30:23,861
So, you should keep thinking about

577
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:25,730
what clothes would look good.

578
00:30:29,174 --> 00:30:31,230
Even when you dress up the arms,

579
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:37,889
you can make the sleeves round.

580
00:30:38,683 --> 00:30:42,417
I'm going to use a diamond silhouette.

581
00:30:47,192 --> 00:30:48,550
Because this character

582
00:30:48,575 --> 00:30:50,678
has both its arms downwards,

583
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:52,535
if I use an inverted triangle silhouette,

584
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,331
I think the shoulders would be too broad.

585
00:30:54,707 --> 00:30:56,872
So, I'm going to make the silhouette

586
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:59,019
have an overall diamond shape.

587
00:30:59,483 --> 00:31:02,074
Instead, I'll draw

588
00:31:02,823 --> 00:31:04,128
a lot of round elements.

589
00:31:04,357 --> 00:31:07,449
That way, it will certainly look cute.

590
00:31:08,505 --> 00:31:11,207
Round hat,

591
00:31:11,549 --> 00:31:12,847
round shoulders,

592
00:31:13,255 --> 00:31:14,363
and round arms.

593
00:31:20,206 --> 00:31:22,059
Even with the gloves,

594
00:31:22,084 --> 00:31:24,040
I'm going to make them round.

595
00:31:24,065 --> 00:31:25,608
I'm also going to make them thick.

596
00:31:30,172 --> 00:31:32,527
Mittens would work well.

597
00:31:37,348 --> 00:31:39,159
The cloth around the neck will be thick, too.

598
00:31:42,473 --> 00:31:44,865
So, overall, the silhouette is round.

599
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:46,607
Now, the viewers should focus their gaze

600
00:31:46,632 --> 00:31:48,714
right in the middle here.

601
00:31:49,002 --> 00:31:52,761
In a diamond silhouette, the gaze goes towards the middle.

602
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:55,675
So, to make the gaze go towards the middle,

603
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,737
we can put more elements for the clothes.

604
00:32:22,925 --> 00:32:25,197
The buttons that I drew

605
00:32:25,222 --> 00:32:27,471
are also part of the silhouette.

606
00:32:27,496 --> 00:32:31,009
If you want to draw buttons on an aggressive character,

607
00:32:33,054 --> 00:32:34,798
it's better to use pointed buttons.

608
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,464
Like this.

609
00:32:40,414 --> 00:32:41,750
Even with small design elements,

610
00:32:41,752 --> 00:32:44,150
it's really important to maintain the silhouette.

611
00:32:44,175 --> 00:32:46,686
When you draw a cute character,

612
00:32:46,687 --> 00:32:49,575
even when a small element like a pointed button is added,

613
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,161
it will look awkward.

614
00:32:51,163 --> 00:32:53,990
So, if you're going for a cute character,

615
00:32:53,992 --> 00:32:56,581
all the lines composing it

616
00:32:56,733 --> 00:32:59,340
should be round.

617
00:32:59,341 --> 00:33:01,480
Then, you can emphasize the mood better.

618
00:33:13,613 --> 00:33:15,742
Let's now design the character

619
00:33:15,767 --> 00:33:17,409
while thinking of ways

620
00:33:19,767 --> 00:33:22,230
for how to make the gaze go upwards.

621
00:33:22,704 --> 00:33:26,478
Exposure is one of the most important elements to use in design.

622
00:33:26,503 --> 00:33:29,676
Basically, people's gaze will head towards the skin.

623
00:33:29,678 --> 00:33:31,814
So, depending on where the exposure is,

624
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:34,399
it will be an effective tool

625
00:33:35,062 --> 00:33:36,684
to direct the gaze intentionally.

626
00:33:36,709 --> 00:33:40,065
For example, I'll create some exposure in this area.

627
00:33:41,231 --> 00:33:43,030
Then, naturally, the gaze would go towards

628
00:33:43,032 --> 00:33:45,026
the waist area around the chest.

629
00:33:47,929 --> 00:33:50,144
Make sure that these outlines

630
00:33:50,169 --> 00:33:51,472
go outwards.

631
00:34:03,992 --> 00:34:06,448
To make the character more round,

632
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:11,042
I'll use things like skirts

633
00:34:13,224 --> 00:34:16,495
to keep using round shapes.

634
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,289
Add in additional visual elements

635
00:34:28,314 --> 00:34:29,915
where you want the gaze to flow.

636
00:34:30,683 --> 00:34:33,109
If you want to add accessories here,

637
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:35,042
make sure they are round too.

638
00:34:43,882 --> 00:34:45,269
The boots should be round as well.

639
00:34:46,504 --> 00:34:49,733
From long boots and short and thick boots,

640
00:34:49,735 --> 00:34:51,605
the latter will look more round.

641
00:34:51,735 --> 00:34:52,835
So, if you're really aiming for

642
00:34:52,837 --> 00:34:54,708
a cute character, the boots should be thick and short too.

643
00:34:55,785 --> 00:34:58,129
That's also why a short character

644
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,994
is generally cuter than a tall character.

645
00:35:00,019 --> 00:35:02,340
The same principle applies here.

646
00:35:02,342 --> 00:35:04,531
With shorter characters, it is easier to

647
00:35:04,533 --> 00:35:08,261
apply round silhouettes.

648
00:35:12,831 --> 00:35:14,748
So, if you're designing a character

649
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,332
and if it doesn't look as cute as you intended,

650
00:35:16,334 --> 00:35:19,605
and if applying round silhouettes isn't enough,

651
00:35:19,713 --> 00:35:22,704
modify the body type of the character as well.

652
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,275
Don't get me wrong.

653
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,471
When you're designing

654
00:35:25,496 --> 00:35:27,269
while drawing an illustration,

655
00:35:27,294 --> 00:35:29,314
the thing we're designing

656
00:35:29,339 --> 00:35:32,431
is the character, just like when we compose a screen.

657
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,252
We're not designing the clothes.

658
00:35:34,385 --> 00:35:35,783
Of course, when you do practical work,

659
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:37,674
you'll design clothes someday.

660
00:35:37,699 --> 00:35:38,900
But, aside from that,

661
00:35:38,902 --> 00:35:40,540
we would normally design

662
00:35:40,565 --> 00:35:42,628
the character itself.

663
00:35:42,833 --> 00:35:44,881
There are a lot of elements to it,

664
00:35:44,906 --> 00:35:46,977
including the skin color, the face shape,

665
00:35:47,198 --> 00:35:49,105
the personality,

666
00:35:49,654 --> 00:35:52,675
and even the body type.

667
00:35:57,850 --> 00:36:00,543
So you should utilize these elements well.

668
00:36:00,988 --> 00:36:02,510
If this character looks too bland

669
00:36:02,512 --> 00:36:05,120
compared to the previous two characters,

670
00:36:11,097 --> 00:36:12,315
from now on,

671
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:15,315
let's utilize the visual aspects more.

672
00:36:15,517 --> 00:36:18,170
Basically, if the main and sub elements

673
00:36:18,172 --> 00:36:20,714
are placed all over and if they are

674
00:36:22,886 --> 00:36:25,098
placed without any empty space,

675
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,605
it's easier to create a cute atmosphere.

676
00:36:26,915 --> 00:36:29,799
When we say something is small and cute,

677
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:33,558
there are usually a lot of round elements

678
00:36:33,583 --> 00:36:35,845
and they are intertwined with each other.

679
00:36:35,846 --> 00:36:40,105
That's what we usually mean by 'small and cute'.

680
00:36:40,707 --> 00:36:42,372
So, when you're drawing a cute character,

681
00:36:42,374 --> 00:36:44,434
it helps if there are a lot of objects around it.

682
00:36:44,459 --> 00:36:47,497
For example, let's say there are spirits

683
00:36:47,499 --> 00:36:49,144
following this character around.

684
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:54,417
They would be floating around it.

685
00:36:57,339 --> 00:36:58,750
Do they look too scary to you?

686
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:00,487
It could be because they're black.

687
00:37:03,552 --> 00:37:05,071
Then, let's make them look cute.

688
00:37:19,759 --> 00:37:22,026
We can draw in eyes like this.

689
00:37:22,415 --> 00:37:25,347
Maintain the overall silhouette of the character

690
00:37:25,372 --> 00:37:28,120
and add pockets and buttons as much as possible.

691
00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:39,105
That way, you will be able to use the silhouette

692
00:37:39,107 --> 00:37:41,815
when you're doing cute characters, too.

693
00:37:49,586 --> 00:37:52,105
Let's change the facial expression

694
00:37:59,854 --> 00:38:02,286
and the hairstyle to fit our intentions.

695
00:38:16,314 --> 00:38:19,025
I'm going to put in side-tails so that the gaze goes up

696
00:38:40,698 --> 00:38:43,120
compared to the triangular silhouette.

697
00:38:43,313 --> 00:38:45,605
So, there are a lot of elements at the top.

698
00:38:45,816 --> 00:38:49,308
But, it's not sharp and pointed like the second example.

699
00:38:49,571 --> 00:38:52,757
We know have a character that is

700
00:38:52,782 --> 00:38:54,339
round and cute.

701
00:38:59,589 --> 00:39:02,281
Design-wise, you can create an atmosphere

702
00:39:02,283 --> 00:39:03,714
just like this.

703
00:39:03,879 --> 00:39:05,912
Of course, like I mentioned before,

704
00:39:05,913 --> 00:39:07,955
the silhouette

705
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,481
applies to the design stage

706
00:39:10,483 --> 00:39:13,855
and the illustration stage.

707
00:39:17,123 --> 00:39:19,636
So, let's find out more about that.

708
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,339
We just went over three examples.

709
00:39:31,932 --> 00:39:34,466
They were a calm character,

710
00:39:35,192 --> 00:39:36,587
an aggressive character,

711
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,699
and a cute character.

712
00:39:42,503 --> 00:39:45,639
I'm sure you've noticed what the differences are.

713
00:39:45,905 --> 00:39:47,046
So, now

714
00:39:48,714 --> 00:39:51,604
let's find out how to use these silhouettes

715
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,800
in illustrations.

716
00:39:52,915 --> 00:39:54,730
For this part, we're going to

717
00:39:54,755 --> 00:39:56,287
analyze some of the works

718
00:39:56,312 --> 00:39:58,620
that I've done so far.

719
00:40:00,714 --> 00:40:02,444
You can clearly see that with this illustration,

720
00:40:02,446 --> 00:40:05,315
the overall silhouette is a triangular shape.

721
00:40:05,392 --> 00:40:06,974
It has a triangular shape,

722
00:40:06,976 --> 00:40:09,486
and if you look at the parts that are yellow,

723
00:40:09,511 --> 00:40:11,283
which is the key color of this piece,

724
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:13,425
they go inwards from outside

725
00:40:13,427 --> 00:40:14,919
and then outwards again.

726
00:40:14,944 --> 00:40:17,230
That is the overall flow.

727
00:40:17,488 --> 00:40:20,189
So, with this illustration, I made sure to

728
00:40:20,191 --> 00:40:21,366
make the gaze focus

729
00:40:21,368 --> 00:40:23,136
in the center as much as possible.

730
00:40:23,657 --> 00:40:27,208
There are a lot of elements at the bottom,

731
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:29,790
but, at the same time, I wanted to make

732
00:40:29,792 --> 00:40:30,838
a strong facial impression.

733
00:40:30,863 --> 00:40:34,567
So, I wanted the gaze to go towards the face.

734
00:40:34,569 --> 00:40:37,646
That's why the letters are at the top.

735
00:40:37,809 --> 00:40:40,245
The letters themselves aren't that important.

736
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:43,340
I induced our gaze to go upwards

737
00:40:43,342 --> 00:40:47,019
by placing the letters at the top, so it's meaningful that way.

738
00:40:47,151 --> 00:40:49,869
So, by using a triangular composition, I made this illustration calm.

739
00:40:49,894 --> 00:40:53,526
But, at the same time, I made the gaze

740
00:40:53,662 --> 00:40:55,409
focus towards the face.

741
00:40:55,434 --> 00:40:57,856
That's what's important.

742
00:41:00,383 --> 00:41:01,999
This example is the complete opposite.

743
00:41:02,429 --> 00:41:04,454
This example has

744
00:41:04,986 --> 00:41:06,673
this kind of composition.

745
00:41:07,245 --> 00:41:10,628
An inverted triangular composition was used.

746
00:41:10,898 --> 00:41:12,666
I wanted to give it a strong impression.

747
00:41:12,691 --> 00:41:14,853
Also, the main element

748
00:41:14,878 --> 00:41:16,055
is the area around the face.

749
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:17,353
And, in this area,

750
00:41:17,378 --> 00:41:20,377
there aren't any elements that make you focus.

751
00:41:20,402 --> 00:41:24,150
All the focal elements are at this part.

752
00:41:24,175 --> 00:41:26,294
And around it, there are elements that act as a point.

753
00:41:26,296 --> 00:41:28,600
You can see flower petals flying around.

754
00:41:28,602 --> 00:41:31,720
Actually, when you make these kind of elements fly around,

755
00:41:31,721 --> 00:41:35,060
you can make them all connected, systemically.

756
00:41:35,288 --> 00:41:38,308
In the end, dots make up a line.

757
00:41:38,463 --> 00:41:41,052
If we have a lot of dots, they will form a line.

758
00:41:41,054 --> 00:41:43,745
With that in mind, I made sure

759
00:41:47,987 --> 00:41:49,294
that these lines

760
00:41:49,902 --> 00:41:53,775
will draw a curve when they are connected.

761
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:58,249
So, you can see that I focused on

762
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:00,174
making the gaze linger a bit longer.

763
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:03,059
The important thing is that by using an inverted triangle,

764
00:42:03,061 --> 00:42:05,400
I created a stronger impression compared to

765
00:42:05,402 --> 00:42:07,651
the previous example with a triangular composition.

766
00:42:12,369 --> 00:42:14,924
If we explicitly use the triangle, we can use it like this.

767
00:42:14,926 --> 00:42:18,026
We're now on the third example.

768
00:42:20,112 --> 00:42:21,338
With this example,

769
00:42:21,363 --> 00:42:24,283
the triangle doesn't cover all of the screen.

770
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:26,226
It only covers the side area.

771
00:42:26,228 --> 00:42:27,605
Also, the middle is empty.

772
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:31,096
So, the area with the characters,

773
00:42:31,121 --> 00:42:33,076
in other words, the area that we would focus on,

774
00:42:33,101 --> 00:42:34,714
is small compared to the whole illustration.

775
00:42:35,332 --> 00:42:37,320
Because the area is small compared to the whole thing,

776
00:42:37,345 --> 00:42:39,441
it will be an illustration

777
00:42:39,466 --> 00:42:41,468
where you can rest your eyes

778
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:44,308
since it is empty overall.

779
00:42:45,174 --> 00:42:46,994
So, if you want to give a calm impression,

780
00:42:46,996 --> 00:42:48,323
you can use this to your advantage.

781
00:42:48,363 --> 00:42:50,865
Say there's only one element in a large area.

782
00:42:50,866 --> 00:42:52,456
Sounds calm, right?

783
00:42:52,518 --> 00:42:54,885
But, if there are a lot of elements that fill up the canvas,

784
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:58,042
it will be more suitable for a cute illustration.

785
00:42:58,605 --> 00:43:02,433
So, with an illustration's first impression,

786
00:43:03,011 --> 00:43:05,856
the silhouette is as impactful as

787
00:43:05,881 --> 00:43:07,260
the things we looked over so far.

788
00:43:07,285 --> 00:43:09,363
So, you can modify these things

789
00:43:09,365 --> 00:43:11,620
depending on the mood

790
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:13,097
you want to create.

791
00:43:13,468 --> 00:43:17,950
Actually, up until now, the things we learned today were similar

792
00:43:17,952 --> 00:43:19,095
to what we learned last time.

793
00:43:19,269 --> 00:43:21,933
What else can we do?

794
00:43:22,113 --> 00:43:24,307
Like I told you at the beginning of today's lecture,

795
00:43:24,332 --> 00:43:25,940
the theories related to the silhouette

796
00:43:25,942 --> 00:43:27,870
are actually endless

797
00:43:27,872 --> 00:43:29,674
when you dive deep into it.

798
00:43:29,699 --> 00:43:31,574
So, you should study these parts,

799
00:43:31,576 --> 00:43:34,120
and make the knowledge your own,

800
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,510
little by little.

801
00:43:35,535 --> 00:43:37,240
What we'll do today is

802
00:43:37,241 --> 00:43:40,487
just go over the essential elements

803
00:43:40,489 --> 00:43:42,550
that are used often for practical work.

804
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:50,453
We're back to composing the canvas.

805
00:43:53,594 --> 00:43:55,992
When we're drawing this character,

806
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:58,713
and making it into an illustration,

807
00:43:58,738 --> 00:44:01,807
let's think about

808
00:44:01,832 --> 00:44:04,088
what we can do

809
00:44:04,113 --> 00:44:05,622
to make this character look cute

810
00:44:05,624 --> 00:44:07,292
or strong.

811
00:44:08,207 --> 00:44:10,150
If you're deciding on whether

812
00:44:10,152 --> 00:44:11,978
you should make the gaze focus or not,

813
00:44:12,003 --> 00:44:13,596
you should make it focus.

814
00:44:13,621 --> 00:44:16,735
Because you would want to make a strong impression

815
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,478
and you would want to

816
00:44:18,503 --> 00:44:20,614
make the viewers actually think

817
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:22,191
that this character looks adorable.

818
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:25,694
If you want to create that atmosphere, the silhouette

819
00:44:25,696 --> 00:44:27,761
should be round overall.

820
00:44:27,786 --> 00:44:29,878
Because we want it to be cute.

821
00:44:30,281 --> 00:44:33,110
We also need to think about the focal points.

822
00:44:33,112 --> 00:44:34,708
The focal points.

823
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:36,586
Where does the character look the most cute?

824
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:39,808
I think it would be the upper body area.

825
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:43,658
So I want to emphasize that area.

826
00:44:43,988 --> 00:44:45,430
I'll emphasize the upper body part

827
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:48,412
and make sure the silhouette has a strong and round impression.

828
00:44:48,574 --> 00:44:52,043
So, let's look at how you would compose the canvas

829
00:44:52,045 --> 00:44:53,768
by applying what we learned.

830
00:44:53,793 --> 00:44:55,824
Let's keep that in mind as we continue.

831
00:44:55,826 --> 00:44:57,666
The first thing I'll tell you about

832
00:44:57,668 --> 00:44:59,433
is a cut-off silhouette.

833
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,367
So, what is it?

834
00:45:01,392 --> 00:45:04,543
When the whole silhouette is on the screen,

835
00:45:06,128 --> 00:45:09,624
and when we can only see part of it,

836
00:45:09,625 --> 00:45:11,734
they create very different atmospheres.

837
00:45:12,113 --> 00:45:15,344
When you watch certain videos, you'll see letterboxes.

838
00:45:15,369 --> 00:45:16,885
What are they?

839
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:20,135
These are the black boxes at the upper and lower part of the screen.

840
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,181
We call these letterboxes

841
00:45:22,183 --> 00:45:23,939
and we put subtitles in them.

842
00:45:23,964 --> 00:45:27,517
This plays a major role in making the viewers focus

843
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:29,050
on the video.

844
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,636
The screen is cut off at the top and bottom

845
00:45:34,196 --> 00:45:37,582
and it would be easier to focus on the middle.

846
00:45:38,112 --> 00:45:39,955
Because we don't like the black boxes,

847
00:45:39,957 --> 00:45:42,276
we tend to focus on the middle.

848
00:45:42,589 --> 00:45:44,622
But this isn't just a theory.

849
00:45:44,624 --> 00:45:47,127
In some horror games,

850
00:45:47,152 --> 00:45:50,204
there are games in the letterbox format.

851
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:51,500
Some developers actually mention this

852
00:45:51,502 --> 00:45:53,051
in their interviews.

853
00:45:53,076 --> 00:45:54,957
They would say that

854
00:45:54,959 --> 00:45:57,711
by adding letterboxes, they made the gamers more terrified

855
00:45:57,712 --> 00:45:58,481
by making the screen narrower.

856
00:45:58,483 --> 00:46:01,430
It is very effective to give a claustrophobic feeling

857
00:46:01,432 --> 00:46:03,043
when you want to instil fear.

858
00:46:03,045 --> 00:46:04,660
So that's why the developers used

859
00:46:04,662 --> 00:46:06,519
letterboxes for their games.

860
00:46:07,105 --> 00:46:08,783
So, why am I mentioning this?

861
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:10,100
Would this be that important

862
00:46:10,102 --> 00:46:11,626
when you want to draw cute characters?

863
00:46:11,651 --> 00:46:12,666
Well,

864
00:46:12,691 --> 00:46:15,018
if you want to give it a strong impression,

865
00:46:15,043 --> 00:46:17,705
and make a strong first impression,

866
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:19,878
cut-off silhouettes are used often.

867
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:22,283
Of course, if you use letterboxes,

868
00:46:22,308 --> 00:46:24,027
it becomes too serious,

869
00:46:24,029 --> 00:46:25,329
so you shouldn't use them.

870
00:46:25,331 --> 00:46:28,690
Nevertheless, not every part of your character should go in the screen.

871
00:46:33,447 --> 00:46:35,197
Just make a part of it be visible.

872
00:47:04,129 --> 00:47:07,119
I'll add in elements that make the character cute.

873
00:47:07,144 --> 00:47:09,670
Should I place the elements around the face

874
00:47:09,672 --> 00:47:11,394
or far away from the face?

875
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:14,534
If they're far away, the atmosphere would be calm.

876
00:47:14,704 --> 00:47:18,743
So, make sure these sub elements

877
00:47:18,768 --> 00:47:20,414
are placed around the face.

878
00:47:48,605 --> 00:47:50,020
Make sure the overall silhouette

879
00:47:50,022 --> 00:47:52,511
is round.

880
00:47:58,266 --> 00:48:01,409
Actually, just make sure all the elements are round.

881
00:48:09,258 --> 00:48:11,107
You can even draw round teeth.

882
00:48:21,626 --> 00:48:25,370
And, to make sure the illustration looks crowded,

883
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,506
let's keep adding more elements.

884
00:48:28,847 --> 00:48:31,374
When we add different elements,

885
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:34,034
they can be utilized to create a cute atmosphere.

886
00:48:39,745 --> 00:48:41,544
The character itself is cut off, like this,

887
00:48:41,569 --> 00:48:43,193
so it's easier to focus on it.

888
00:48:43,195 --> 00:48:45,267
It will make a strong first impression,

889
00:48:45,269 --> 00:48:48,120
and it has a round silhouette.

890
00:48:48,648 --> 00:48:52,558
It also has an inverted triangular composition, not a triangular one.

891
00:48:52,667 --> 00:48:54,594
So, our gaze focuses on the top.

892
00:48:54,596 --> 00:48:57,542
And the canvas looks very crowded.

893
00:49:04,082 --> 00:49:07,494
So, what we've learned about the silhouette

894
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:09,594
is not only applied to the design stage

895
00:49:09,596 --> 00:49:10,831
but to the illustration stage as well.

896
00:49:11,195 --> 00:49:12,940
Let's summarize.

897
00:49:13,394 --> 00:49:15,360
The silhouette is related to the plane

898
00:49:15,362 --> 00:49:17,675
from among the point, line and plane.

899
00:49:18,895 --> 00:49:23,041
The plane decides our first impression.

900
00:49:23,436 --> 00:49:24,932
There are a lot of different types,

901
00:49:24,957 --> 00:49:26,921
and today, we went over

902
00:49:26,923 --> 00:49:30,334
the triangular composition, the inverted triangular composition,

903
00:49:30,591 --> 00:49:31,985
the diamond composition, and the 8-shaped composition.

904
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:35,451
That would make the first impression.

905
00:49:35,453 --> 00:49:38,682
The second impression would be related to the feeling of the silhouette.

906
00:49:38,683 --> 00:49:42,380
Whether it's round, curved, or pointed.

907
00:49:42,527 --> 00:49:44,944
Utilizing these well will help you focus on

908
00:49:44,946 --> 00:49:47,189
expressing a character's atmosphere.

909
00:49:47,214 --> 00:49:49,990
So, mix and match these as you want,

910
00:49:49,991 --> 00:49:52,229
to describe the character you want.

911
00:49:52,231 --> 00:49:53,941
So, I showed you three examples

912
00:49:53,942 --> 00:49:56,136
that could be used in character design.

913
00:49:56,635 --> 00:49:59,379
And, with the theories related to the gaze,

914
00:49:59,951 --> 00:50:03,944
I drew a thumbnail of an example used for illustrations.

915
00:50:04,812 --> 00:50:06,398
Keep these in mind,

916
00:50:06,423 --> 00:50:08,831
and as you do so, we'll work on illustrations later on.

917
00:50:10,233 --> 00:50:12,231
I'll go over them once more in later classes.

918
00:50:12,233 --> 00:50:14,775
From now on, we'll focus on the design.

919
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,319
We'll utilize the silhouette

920
00:50:16,321 --> 00:50:18,195
and the gaze

921
00:50:18,197 --> 00:50:20,230
to simply design a character.

922
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,223
We'll design the character

923
00:50:22,225 --> 00:50:24,874
and we'll create a full illustration based on it.

924
00:50:24,875 --> 00:50:26,201
It would be an illustration

925
00:50:26,203 --> 00:50:27,012
with a background.

926
00:50:27,256 --> 00:50:30,430
We'll also work on portrait illustrations.

927
00:50:30,432 --> 00:50:32,511
Like this one.

928
00:50:33,609 --> 00:50:36,914
When you do that, apply what you've learned

929
00:50:36,916 --> 00:50:39,603
and create the atmosphere you're going for

930
00:50:39,628 --> 00:50:42,105
when you make a character.

931
00:50:42,607 --> 00:50:44,447
That's all for now,

932
00:50:44,472 --> 00:50:47,440
so that's the end of today's lecture.

933
00:50:47,465 --> 00:50:49,042
Keep up the great work.
