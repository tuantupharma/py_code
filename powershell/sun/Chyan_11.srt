2
00:00:05,783 --> 00:00:06,813
Hello.

3
00:00:06,813 --> 00:00:08,436
From today, we are going to work on Section 4.

4
00:00:08,437 --> 00:00:09,623
The actual drawing part.

5
00:00:09,624 --> 00:00:11,358
So from today, we are going to go through an illustration.

6
00:00:12,024 --> 00:00:14,147
So I brought back the character from the previous class.

7
00:00:14,148 --> 00:00:15,773
By using this character,

8
00:00:15,773 --> 00:00:17,810
we will go through the process

9
00:00:17,811 --> 00:00:19,816
of editing a thumbnail.

10
00:00:20,196 --> 00:00:23,922
If you're drawing while you follow this class,

11
00:00:23,922 --> 00:00:26,701
you will work with the character from a design stage.

12
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:28,806
We are going to compose a thumbnail together.

13
00:00:29,177 --> 00:00:31,247
Before we start, remind yourself.

14
00:00:31,257 --> 00:00:32,891
What is a thumbnail?

15
00:00:32,892 --> 00:00:34,817
We should take some time to find out.

16
00:00:35,065 --> 00:00:36,932
When it comes to thumbnails,

17
00:00:36,933 --> 00:00:39,592
it literally means

18
00:00:41,851 --> 00:00:44,491
thumb for thumb,

19
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:49,255
and a nail.

20
00:00:49,265 --> 00:00:53,123
So it means to draw it small like a thumbnail,

21
00:00:53,123 --> 00:00:55,194
that's why it's called a thumbnail sketch.

22
00:00:56,188 --> 00:00:57,641
So you draw it small,

23
00:00:57,642 --> 00:01:01,107
to quickly pick the image that you're going to draw.

24
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:06,033
I think I've told you about speed before.

25
00:01:07,227 --> 00:01:10,382
I talked about it for the brief sketch in section 2.

26
00:01:10,513 --> 00:01:12,908
I emphasized the speed.

27
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:14,705
Do you remember the reason?

28
00:01:14,706 --> 00:01:18,053
To get the image that came to your mind,

29
00:01:18,054 --> 00:01:19,310
it is important to do it promptly.

30
00:01:19,453 --> 00:01:22,999
Because you only have about 15 seconds to remember your image.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,913
To get the vibe out quickly within that time,

32
00:01:25,922 --> 00:01:28,526
we do a thumbnail sketch.

33
00:01:28,527 --> 00:01:30,890
So, the thumbnail sketch

34
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:32,797
is not the time to do a human body.

35
00:01:33,623 --> 00:01:36,935
Usually, students set the pose of the character

36
00:01:36,936 --> 00:01:38,861
to set the composition of an illustration.

37
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:42,873
I try to adjust the body proportions while making poses,

38
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,012
and fix the lines,

39
00:01:44,013 --> 00:01:46,792
and in time the face gets prettier and more in detail,

40
00:01:46,793 --> 00:01:49,091
but the image that popped up in my mind becomes faded.

41
00:01:49,092 --> 00:01:51,117
And my drawing is

42
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:53,632
different from the image I wanted.

43
00:01:54,483 --> 00:01:56,841
If you have an outcome like that,

44
00:01:56,842 --> 00:01:58,986
you might have to fix that later,

45
00:01:58,987 --> 00:02:00,557
or you end up drawing a new one.

46
00:02:00,711 --> 00:02:02,378
So at this stage,

47
00:02:02,379 --> 00:02:03,968
it's not about the human body.

48
00:02:04,231 --> 00:02:07,904
We divided the sketch stages

49
00:02:07,904 --> 00:02:09,215
into 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th sketches.

50
00:02:09,335 --> 00:02:12,303
In the 1st movement,

51
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:16,304
in other words, if you look at it as an illustration,

52
00:02:17,395 --> 00:02:20,527
focus on expressing the nuances quickly.

53
00:02:20,594 --> 00:02:22,133
That is very important.

54
00:02:22,134 --> 00:02:23,537
Just in case,

55
00:02:23,537 --> 00:02:26,129
if you keep trying to fit the human body in while this is going on,

56
00:02:26,138 --> 00:02:27,834
you have to catch yourself at that point.

57
00:02:27,834 --> 00:02:29,220
You have to stop on your own.

58
00:02:29,427 --> 00:02:30,610
It's very important.

59
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:33,765
But to do the first sketch,

60
00:02:33,774 --> 00:02:35,177
it's a bit difficult.

61
00:02:35,194 --> 00:02:36,572
If you think it's hard to draw a stick figure,

62
00:02:36,581 --> 00:02:40,480
from the 1st sketch,

63
00:02:40,497 --> 00:02:42,068
that means you don't have enough practice for the simplification process

64
00:02:42,068 --> 00:02:44,046
which you practiced earlier in Section 2.

65
00:02:44,071 --> 00:02:45,739
You have to keep practicing.

66
00:02:45,764 --> 00:02:48,592
Or if you can't think of the scene,

67
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:52,282
then, find the references that we did in Sections 1-2.

68
00:02:53,517 --> 00:02:55,321
You may something that you can get motivated by,

69
00:02:56,308 --> 00:02:59,021
so take out an image that could help with your motivation.

70
00:02:59,021 --> 00:03:00,415
Refer to that image

71
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:01,944
to make the composition.

72
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,120
If you look at a few images,

73
00:03:04,128 --> 00:03:06,589
there's bound to be one that you like.

74
00:03:06,607 --> 00:03:08,884
There must be one 'friend' who will inspire you.

75
00:03:08,886 --> 00:03:10,652
If you make a composition using that friend,

76
00:03:10,677 --> 00:03:12,680
it'll be easier to access.

77
00:03:12,681 --> 00:03:15,473
Since I'm doing a demonstration today,

78
00:03:15,498 --> 00:03:17,201
I'm going to do it without any references.

79
00:03:17,226 --> 00:03:18,521
For the students who are watching,

80
00:03:18,546 --> 00:03:20,913
at this point, I recommend you to get a copy of

81
00:03:21,087 --> 00:03:23,286
a piece of material to refer to the feeling.

82
00:03:23,311 --> 00:03:25,701
So by referring to that one,

83
00:03:25,702 --> 00:03:27,847
it would be better to work with it.

84
00:03:28,607 --> 00:03:31,876
I told you that the advantage of the thumbnail is that it's quick.

85
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:33,909
Therefore,

86
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,382
by getting as many types as possible,

87
00:03:36,407 --> 00:03:39,426
it's time to think about what to do to make this one prettier.

88
00:03:39,873 --> 00:03:43,213
You can think of it as a kind of lucky draw.

89
00:03:43,238 --> 00:03:44,791
So you spin it as many times as possible,

90
00:03:44,816 --> 00:03:46,070
to increase the probability.

91
00:03:46,095 --> 00:03:47,910
The probability of a pretty illustration coming out.

92
00:03:47,976 --> 00:03:50,304
And of course, I put my heart and soul into it

93
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:53,287
to make a pretty-looking image.

94
00:03:53,289 --> 00:03:55,798
It's also a worthwhile act.

95
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,527
It doesn't matter if you do that.

96
00:03:58,134 --> 00:03:59,626
Or pick a lot...

97
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:02,323
every one of them adds to your experience.

98
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:05,571
This thumbnail makes you study better compared to the time you put in.

99
00:04:06,978 --> 00:04:10,721
In a way, you can see it as a practice process.

100
00:04:10,779 --> 00:04:12,953
So, it's important to take out as many thumbnails as possible,

101
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,050
by seeing how well your screen is organized,

102
00:04:15,051 --> 00:04:17,938
and keep increasing it.

103
00:04:17,963 --> 00:04:20,194
What you should be careful about when choosing the thumbnail is

104
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:23,629
based on the premise that you're going to start now,

105
00:04:23,728 --> 00:04:26,904
the most important thing is,

106
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,701
the one thing you need to pay attention to in the thumbnail is

107
00:04:30,734 --> 00:04:32,780
that you're trying to make it look good.

108
00:04:32,797 --> 00:04:35,520
If I have to pick one thing that's the most important,

109
00:04:35,545 --> 00:04:37,938
as expected, it's...

110
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,206
Where is the point that you want to draw attention to.

111
00:04:42,298 --> 00:04:44,201
We're going to work on this character

112
00:04:44,202 --> 00:04:45,921
in the middle.

113
00:04:45,922 --> 00:04:47,445
It changed a little bit from what we worked on

114
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,615
in the previous design class.

115
00:04:49,632 --> 00:04:52,013
So I'm going to use this one to work with.

116
00:04:52,587 --> 00:04:55,225
When it comes to showing this one to people,

117
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,753
what would be the most effective way?

118
00:04:57,793 --> 00:05:00,599
Or what is the point you want to emphasize?

119
00:05:00,813 --> 00:05:02,730
Let's focus on this.

120
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:05,669
We have to construct a screen with it.

121
00:05:07,356 --> 00:05:09,266
It depends on the person.

122
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:12,388
If you want to want to emphasize this character's face charmingly,

123
00:05:12,943 --> 00:05:15,575
or if you want to emphasize the tooth part of the hat,

124
00:05:16,202 --> 00:05:19,639
or if you want to emphasize the shoulder line,

125
00:05:20,285 --> 00:05:22,404
or if you want to emphasize a pretty skirt,

126
00:05:22,604 --> 00:05:25,203
you may want to show the overall silhouette of the outfit,

127
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,411
it could be the creature in the background,

128
00:05:27,726 --> 00:05:29,621
or the lines on the legs,

129
00:05:30,566 --> 00:05:32,852
or using your overall skills,

130
00:05:32,877 --> 00:05:34,574
making a fancy image,

131
00:05:35,553 --> 00:05:38,801
or you can include a character in a dark image,

132
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,800
there are so many things that you can do.

133
00:05:41,825 --> 00:05:43,682
So you need to clarify that first,

134
00:05:43,707 --> 00:05:45,166
and based on what you decided upon,

135
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:47,477
it is important to organize this screen.

136
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:49,651
As expected, the second one came out just now.

137
00:05:49,712 --> 00:05:52,679
What we compose is not the posing of the characters,

138
00:05:52,704 --> 00:05:53,755
but the screen itself.

139
00:05:54,974 --> 00:05:56,785
We went through this in a previous class, too.

140
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,951
But it's important, so we must decide this before we move on.

141
00:05:58,951 --> 00:06:00,863
What we are composing is

142
00:06:00,888 --> 00:06:02,426
a square screen here.

143
00:06:02,893 --> 00:06:05,331
No one draws triangular illustrations, for the most part.

144
00:06:05,356 --> 00:06:07,888
Sometimes, inside a square,

145
00:06:07,913 --> 00:06:10,321
people draw a triangular screen,

146
00:06:10,585 --> 00:06:12,125
but most of us do full illustrations,

147
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,902
so when you draw illustrations with a background,

148
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,338
you draw an illustration inside a square.

149
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,188
Either horizontally or vertically,

150
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,238
inside this square,

151
00:06:21,331 --> 00:06:23,599
the characters are arranged,

152
00:06:23,624 --> 00:06:25,865
but actually, this character is a kind of material.

153
00:06:26,312 --> 00:06:28,926
It's like meat in terms of cooking.

154
00:06:29,407 --> 00:06:31,099
Although it stands out a lot among the other elements,

155
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,495
it's just an ingredient.

156
00:06:32,835 --> 00:06:35,811
We're going to use this to create a thumbnail.

157
00:06:35,836 --> 00:06:38,704
This thumbnail is like a recipe for cooking.

158
00:06:40,177 --> 00:06:42,173
The part you want to emphasize,

159
00:06:42,174 --> 00:06:45,024
or where you want highlight,

160
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:46,903
depending on how you plan it,

161
00:06:46,921 --> 00:06:49,298
the ingredients I use are different, too.

162
00:06:49,323 --> 00:06:51,100
You can put in vegetables as sub ingredients,

163
00:06:51,297 --> 00:06:52,773
or you can add other main ingredients,

164
00:06:52,798 --> 00:06:54,172
or maybe you could add noodles

165
00:06:54,173 --> 00:06:55,295
and rice,

166
00:06:55,454 --> 00:06:57,030
the sub ingredients will be different,

167
00:06:57,296 --> 00:06:58,528
and in the process of cooking,

168
00:06:58,553 --> 00:07:00,600
you can choose whether to cook it or not.

169
00:07:00,993 --> 00:07:02,298
It works the same for drawing.

170
00:07:02,323 --> 00:07:04,087
In the end, it's about how to express the sections

171
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:05,931
that you want to emphasize.

172
00:07:05,932 --> 00:07:07,299
So while composing the screen,

173
00:07:07,324 --> 00:07:09,510
We need to keep thinking about

174
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,407
where we want to place our emphasis.

175
00:07:12,794 --> 00:07:14,316
That's all for the introduction.

176
00:07:16,322 --> 00:07:18,048
Let's move on to the practice.

177
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:20,843
I'm going to use this one to create a thumbnail.

178
00:07:41,688 --> 00:07:44,124
The reason why I painted the background gray is

179
00:07:44,225 --> 00:07:46,515
just that my eyes hurt because it's too bright.

180
00:07:47,994 --> 00:07:49,925
You don't have to paint it like this.

181
00:07:53,502 --> 00:07:56,375
Which part should I draw to emphasize the charm?

182
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,464
While drawing the illustration,

183
00:07:59,465 --> 00:08:01,692
taking a look at my intentions again,

184
00:08:01,693 --> 00:08:02,724
afterwards,

185
00:08:02,724 --> 00:08:05,049
based on today's illustration,

186
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,250
I'm going to break it up into several parts.

187
00:08:08,907 --> 00:08:11,252
I'm going to break it into a cute and bright image,

188
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:14,607
and I'm going to try a calm image,

189
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:16,408
maybe a strong image,

190
00:08:16,785 --> 00:08:18,310
or a sentimental image.

191
00:08:18,722 --> 00:08:21,730
I'm going to fix this 'friend' in many ways.

192
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:25,405
Rather than a strong impression

193
00:08:25,899 --> 00:08:27,151
from the screen,

194
00:08:27,176 --> 00:08:28,482
at this stage,

195
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:31,597
I intend to set a plain screen.

196
00:08:32,805 --> 00:08:34,605
You don't have to do that.

197
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:37,232
It's okay to focus on

198
00:08:37,232 --> 00:08:39,432
composing a screen that you think is pretty.

199
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:41,382
First of all, I'll...

200
00:08:41,407 --> 00:08:43,497
Let's see how we're going to come up with this.

201
00:08:43,522 --> 00:08:44,822
Let's think about it.

202
00:08:45,906 --> 00:08:47,810
What part can we express prettily?

203
00:08:47,892 --> 00:08:50,820
While I was working on this character,

204
00:08:50,902 --> 00:08:52,557
the sharp tooth,

205
00:08:52,694 --> 00:08:54,483
and the eyes are a bit unique,

206
00:08:54,508 --> 00:08:56,017
also the hat is a bit unique

207
00:08:56,321 --> 00:08:57,647
and this one on the back,

208
00:08:57,672 --> 00:09:00,562
I do think these are pretty in my point of view.

209
00:09:02,599 --> 00:09:04,622
So in this section,

210
00:09:04,972 --> 00:09:06,527
let's say you want to draw attention.

211
00:09:07,398 --> 00:09:08,599
To do that,

212
00:09:08,624 --> 00:09:09,915
let's compose the screen.

213
00:09:10,199 --> 00:09:11,911
How should we apply the angle?

214
00:09:11,912 --> 00:09:15,217
At this stage, we'll think about the angle together.

215
00:09:15,405 --> 00:09:17,537
To show what you want,

216
00:09:17,562 --> 00:09:19,305
the pose of the character,

217
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:22,313
and in order to show the parts that you want to emphasize,

218
00:09:22,338 --> 00:09:23,586
the angle,

219
00:09:23,611 --> 00:09:25,899
and the way surrounding elements are arranged,

220
00:09:26,272 --> 00:09:27,968
the coloring,

221
00:09:28,294 --> 00:09:29,604
and the way to apply the lighting,

222
00:09:29,629 --> 00:09:33,314
if possible, it's good to think about these in the thumbnail level.

223
00:09:33,415 --> 00:09:35,511
Of course, we can't do it all at once.

224
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:38,713
There are still a lot of people who can't do it all together.

225
00:09:38,731 --> 00:09:41,295
You can do it step by step.

226
00:09:41,327 --> 00:09:43,306
But when you get used to it later on,

227
00:09:43,308 --> 00:09:46,139
I think it's better to compose from the thumbnail up to the colors.

228
00:09:46,164 --> 00:09:47,255
It's the best method.

229
00:09:48,328 --> 00:09:49,850
Let's compose it together.

230
00:09:53,489 --> 00:09:55,528
I'm going to use the high angle.

231
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:58,225
I told you that the previous angle was too widened.

232
00:09:59,078 --> 00:10:01,102
I'm going to put the camera closer.

233
00:10:01,155 --> 00:10:03,581
That's why it feels like the angle is spreading,

234
00:10:03,606 --> 00:10:06,320
a bit stronger than the previous one.

235
00:10:21,703 --> 00:10:22,973
At the thumbnail level,

236
00:10:22,974 --> 00:10:25,411
I tend to draw the character's facial features.

237
00:10:36,119 --> 00:10:37,613
Rather than aligning the human body,

238
00:10:37,614 --> 00:10:39,547
I'll focus on getting the right vibe.

239
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,215
To show the hat clearly, I turn on the angle.

240
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:53,818
If you do this,

241
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,738
since the hat goes into a low angle,

242
00:10:55,763 --> 00:10:58,822
you will be able to show the teeth of the hat,

243
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:00,661
and you can see the character's face well,

244
00:11:00,686 --> 00:11:02,921
with the clothes on the bottom spread out like this,

245
00:11:03,634 --> 00:11:05,580
so you can see it up to the neck.

246
00:11:06,009 --> 00:11:09,117
But if you have that strength, you always have a weakness.

247
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:11,325
This is my theory,

248
00:11:11,865 --> 00:11:13,812
but there are always pros and cons.

249
00:11:13,814 --> 00:11:15,838
There's no method with pros only.

250
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:20,573
But if the pros are worth more than the cons,

251
00:11:20,574 --> 00:11:22,491
I think that screen is the best.

252
00:11:23,289 --> 00:11:25,985
As the high angle goes in intensively,

253
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,211
you give a strong impression,

254
00:11:28,236 --> 00:11:30,140
since the eyes are focused on the face,

255
00:11:30,165 --> 00:11:31,901
if you show the body design,

256
00:11:31,902 --> 00:11:33,047
or if you add a lot of surrounding elements,

257
00:11:33,048 --> 00:11:34,781
it's going to get too complicated.

258
00:11:35,031 --> 00:11:36,078
Like that,

259
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:37,880
according to the method that you chose,

260
00:11:38,105 --> 00:11:41,708
the screen has strengths and weaknesses.

261
00:11:41,805 --> 00:11:44,036
It's even better if you think about it all together.

262
00:11:44,374 --> 00:11:45,704
In that regard,

263
00:11:45,729 --> 00:11:47,608
the answer is up to you.

264
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,064
What would be good for this one?

265
00:11:50,065 --> 00:11:51,282
Which part would be good?

266
00:11:51,718 --> 00:11:53,528
If there's something you don't get,

267
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:55,896
looking at other illustrations of similar lines,

268
00:11:55,921 --> 00:11:57,325
we need to analyze them.

269
00:11:57,503 --> 00:12:00,490
Like, this is similar to the illustration I was going to draw.

270
00:12:00,515 --> 00:12:02,403
While this is a strength,

271
00:12:02,428 --> 00:12:05,403
this part is a bit weak.

272
00:12:07,592 --> 00:12:09,717
The process of finding that is part of studying.

273
00:12:10,888 --> 00:12:12,160
When it comes to drawing,

274
00:12:12,185 --> 00:12:14,218
I think it's a very important process.

275
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,800
If possible, in this process,

276
00:12:23,825 --> 00:12:25,213
don't spend too much time on it.

277
00:12:27,917 --> 00:12:29,878
I want to show the legs, too.

278
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:31,294
So lift the legs a bit,

279
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:35,606
to show this one which didn't have a tooth shape.

280
00:12:38,496 --> 00:12:41,015
We made some outerwear before.

281
00:12:41,809 --> 00:12:43,041
Using the outerwear,

282
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:45,581
if you want to draw a pretty outfit that droops down,

283
00:12:49,156 --> 00:12:51,328
then compose the overall vibe,

284
00:12:51,428 --> 00:12:52,856
and it's enough if you could understand what you want in the draft.

285
00:12:52,881 --> 00:12:54,307
Even if other people can't get it,

286
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:56,015
it's enough if you can see it.

287
00:12:58,115 --> 00:12:59,545
If you set the overall atmosphere,

288
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,268
work on the 2nd sketch with this one.

289
00:13:02,293 --> 00:13:03,430
In case you like it.

290
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,976
If you don't like it, try to design it until you like it.

291
00:13:04,977 --> 00:13:06,808
You have to keep designing until you get what you like.

292
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:08,385
First of all, I'll start

293
00:13:08,393 --> 00:13:11,112
the 2nd sketch and design another one.

294
00:13:15,185 --> 00:13:16,664
When we go into the second sketch,

295
00:13:16,665 --> 00:13:18,098
zoom in on this,

296
00:13:18,123 --> 00:13:19,789
and erase it again.

297
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,965
Or maybe creating a new layer

298
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,607
would be a good method.

299
00:13:28,869 --> 00:13:30,781
Let's start the 2nd sketch.

300
00:13:31,721 --> 00:13:32,944
In the 2nd sketch,

301
00:13:32,969 --> 00:13:37,025
it's good to set the facial features to a certain extent.

302
00:13:37,207 --> 00:13:39,452
It's okay to set it in the 3rd sketch,

303
00:13:39,525 --> 00:13:42,215
but the reason why I recommend setting it up in advance for the 2nd sketch is,

304
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:43,858
if you have any errors in this part,

305
00:13:43,883 --> 00:13:45,154
you may need to fix the body first,

306
00:13:45,156 --> 00:13:46,920
to draw a new face.

307
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,521
So if that happens, there's a lot of editing involved, right?

308
00:13:50,715 --> 00:13:52,610
You may have a hard time working on it.

309
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:58,241
I think it's okay to spend some time on the face.

310
00:13:58,788 --> 00:14:01,811
That's how important the face is when it comes to characters.

311
00:14:04,648 --> 00:14:05,785
If you want the character's sharp teeth

312
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,624
to be pretty,

313
00:14:07,967 --> 00:14:09,758
it'd be nice if you could direct them,

314
00:14:18,994 --> 00:14:20,318
making the mouth as big as possible.

315
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:23,308
So make the eyes as wide as possible,

316
00:14:23,951 --> 00:14:27,425
and make space on the top and bottom, and when its eyes open,

317
00:14:27,443 --> 00:14:29,750
you can make it look like it's opening its eyes wide.

318
00:14:29,781 --> 00:14:33,665
And for double eyelids, unlike the previous one, with half of them up,

319
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:35,612
it's better to put them on as much as possible.

320
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,794
So it's going to look at the center.

321
00:14:44,405 --> 00:14:46,724
Put it in the middle like this.

322
00:15:04,216 --> 00:15:06,403
So it kind of has a scary impression,

323
00:15:07,892 --> 00:15:09,205
but later on,

324
00:15:09,222 --> 00:15:12,614
we're going to look at other examples when we move on to the nuance part.

325
00:15:27,414 --> 00:15:29,058
I'll draw the mouth again.

326
00:15:59,476 --> 00:16:01,211
Even if it's your 2nd sketch,

327
00:16:01,212 --> 00:16:02,824
you don't have to be nervous.

328
00:16:02,825 --> 00:16:06,103
We're going to go through the 3rd and 4th sketches anyway.

329
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,722
We need to edit the 3rd and 4th sketches while checking the details.

330
00:16:10,042 --> 00:16:14,136
In the 2nd sketch,

331
00:16:14,161 --> 00:16:16,000
what we need to do is to get the overall vibe.

332
00:16:18,098 --> 00:16:20,981
But the hair that we learned before, etc.,

333
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,376
try to apply these theories as much as possible.

334
00:16:25,898 --> 00:16:27,413
The ratio of the characters,

335
00:16:28,265 --> 00:16:30,210
and the errors,

336
00:16:31,196 --> 00:16:32,888
I've told you this before.

337
00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:36,021
Rough sketches and theories.

338
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:40,513
So, when it comes to the facts, drawing accurately,

339
00:16:40,538 --> 00:16:42,015
the feeling is more important.

340
00:16:42,108 --> 00:16:43,837
You need to put the feeling first.

341
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:51,380
It means that some errors in the human body and things like that

342
00:16:51,405 --> 00:16:55,289
are a bit understandable when it's a casual drawing.

343
00:16:56,395 --> 00:16:58,530
Some people say,

344
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:03,255
that it's charming with little glitches.

345
00:17:06,397 --> 00:17:09,393
It's not like I'm telling you to make mistakes.

346
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,139
But it means don't be too afraid of them.

347
00:17:13,361 --> 00:17:15,512
Just draw the overall flow of the hair.

348
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:20,641
For now, I'll draw around this much.

349
00:17:26,456 --> 00:17:27,719
In the 2nd sketch,

350
00:17:27,727 --> 00:17:29,512
it's important to adjust the body.

351
00:17:29,523 --> 00:17:31,556
You don't have to draw the outfit for a second.

352
00:17:32,303 --> 00:17:35,859
For the 1st sketch, we only had silhouettes.

353
00:17:43,885 --> 00:17:45,094
Therefore,

354
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:48,708
let's focus on editing the body.

355
00:17:51,308 --> 00:17:53,146
I'm going to draw the upper body smaller.

356
00:17:53,883 --> 00:17:55,729
Because it's a small character.

357
00:18:10,403 --> 00:18:12,718
I'm going to lift the legs a little bit.

358
00:18:27,081 --> 00:18:30,284
It's okay to just put this hand down,

359
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,517
but to make it fun,

360
00:18:33,977 --> 00:18:35,644
I'll stretch it out.

361
00:18:41,398 --> 00:18:43,516
Do you remember the basic hand structure?

362
00:19:00,485 --> 00:19:02,623
In the 2nd sketch,

363
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,906
it's time to improve the accuracy of the human body.

364
00:19:04,907 --> 00:19:06,012
That's what it's for.

365
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:09,764
After checking the accuracy in the 2nd sketch,

366
00:19:09,925 --> 00:19:12,517
and if there's no big mistakes,

367
00:19:12,603 --> 00:19:14,315
let's move on to the 3rd sketch.

368
00:19:16,476 --> 00:19:19,100
We're going to do up to the 3rd sketch today.

369
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:25,704
We're going to make a few more thumbnails.

370
00:19:26,005 --> 00:19:27,690
Try to make it wide horizontally,

371
00:19:28,184 --> 00:19:30,487
and since we emphasized the face,

372
00:19:30,512 --> 00:19:32,105
we'll have to emphasize other things, too.

373
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:48,934
We can emphasize this by putting an extra strand of hair.

374
00:19:49,805 --> 00:19:51,422
We also call this 'ahoge' hair.

375
00:19:51,447 --> 00:19:52,922
So we need to emphasize that, too.

376
00:19:53,795 --> 00:19:56,096
And put the decorations on the back of the head.

377
00:19:57,198 --> 00:19:59,218
The sharpness of its hair,

378
00:20:00,012 --> 00:20:03,340
highlight these details in the 3rd sketch.

379
00:20:03,892 --> 00:20:06,890
Since I'm demonstrating right now, I'm in a hurry,

380
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:09,994
but you can do the 3rd sketch slowly.

381
00:20:10,832 --> 00:20:12,802
It's already the 3rd sketch.

382
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,410
Usually, until the 2nd round, it's mostly done with the thumbnail.

383
00:20:15,557 --> 00:20:17,387
From the 3rd sketch,

384
00:20:17,412 --> 00:20:19,737
if you think you can proceed further with this design,

385
00:20:20,005 --> 00:20:24,478
it would be okay to continue to the end,

386
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,696
you can make a decision.

387
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:29,522
You can work on the 3rd sketch when you've decided.

388
00:20:34,569 --> 00:20:35,618
Therefore,

389
00:20:35,618 --> 00:20:37,907
from the 3rd sketch, try to be as precise as possible.

390
00:20:37,908 --> 00:20:40,212
It's important to draw,

391
00:20:43,129 --> 00:20:44,715
expressing everything you can.

392
00:21:03,016 --> 00:21:05,911
So, accentuate the worn-out look of the outfit.

393
00:21:09,812 --> 00:21:12,549
And maintain the design of the half-glove.

394
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:22,220
At this point, we're going to express the nails.

395
00:21:31,278 --> 00:21:32,835
The perspective is a bit off here.

396
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:36,156
The perspective on the floor,

397
00:21:36,181 --> 00:21:38,309
is applied like this.

398
00:21:38,709 --> 00:21:41,243
So if you look at the part where the legs are placed,

399
00:21:41,268 --> 00:21:43,403
you'll be able to get used to it.

400
00:21:43,757 --> 00:21:45,218
When you put your legs on the cuboid

401
00:21:45,385 --> 00:21:47,380
and if they look natural, it's all good.

402
00:22:11,988 --> 00:22:14,112
The arms were a bit short, so let's put them down.

403
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:36,396
Draw the design of the skirt,

404
00:22:50,249 --> 00:22:51,623
and cut the screen.

405
00:22:53,293 --> 00:22:55,299
Also, when you make the thumbnail,

406
00:22:55,324 --> 00:22:57,674
some people don't draw in a square.

407
00:22:57,699 --> 00:22:59,547
If possible, I recommend you do to a square

408
00:22:59,548 --> 00:23:00,609
before you work on it.

409
00:23:01,215 --> 00:23:04,038
It's a way not to forget

410
00:23:04,063 --> 00:23:05,858
what we're composing is the screen.

411
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,641
So that you can

412
00:23:07,945 --> 00:23:10,570
approach it like that.

413
00:23:12,597 --> 00:23:15,291
There could be a part that sticks out of the square.

414
00:23:15,316 --> 00:23:17,724
If possible, make a big canvas like this.

415
00:23:18,008 --> 00:23:19,629
Draw a small square in it.

416
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:24,015
I recommend you do a thumbnail sketch inside the square.

417
00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:51,262
Try to apply the designs that we've done before.

418
00:23:51,608 --> 00:23:53,949
In the area where there's some space in the back,

419
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:57,690
I wanted to apply the character's creature part, if possible.

420
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,417
So I'll put it in the back like this.

421
00:24:10,501 --> 00:24:13,203
I told you about the gazing part earlier.

422
00:24:15,595 --> 00:24:18,008
I told you that we need to focus on the face.

423
00:24:19,101 --> 00:24:21,079
Let's see if it's really focused.

424
00:24:21,104 --> 00:24:23,281
Okay, let's do the perspective calculation.

425
00:24:23,306 --> 00:24:26,836
By bending the face like this,

426
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:29,005
low angle,

427
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:30,524
slightly low angle,

428
00:24:30,808 --> 00:24:32,108
slightly high angle,

429
00:24:33,585 --> 00:24:34,591
a bit higher angle,

430
00:24:34,616 --> 00:24:36,023
then even the high angle,

431
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,695
so the part that goes around a lot,

432
00:24:38,696 --> 00:24:40,430
is focused on the face.

433
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:41,998
If it's composed like this,

434
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:43,820
people's gaze will

435
00:24:43,845 --> 00:24:45,918
also focus on the face very naturally.

436
00:24:47,984 --> 00:24:49,363
Let's see how people's gaze

437
00:24:49,388 --> 00:24:51,668
on the illustration flows.

438
00:24:51,693 --> 00:24:53,613
As we learned in the gaze part,

439
00:24:54,586 --> 00:24:56,356
we're going to look at the face,

440
00:24:56,381 --> 00:24:58,880
and it's a must to see the face in the character illustration.

441
00:24:58,905 --> 00:25:02,512
I think it's okay to say that 80 to 90 percent of the time you see the face.

442
00:25:02,985 --> 00:25:04,427
If you saw the face like this,

443
00:25:04,435 --> 00:25:07,087
the gaze will go down along the body.

444
00:25:07,491 --> 00:25:08,894
The gaze that went down like this,

445
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:11,169
might be bland if it just ends like that.

446
00:25:11,194 --> 00:25:13,726
So when you draw the line of the gaze,

447
00:25:13,751 --> 00:25:15,720
it's good to check if there's a connected part.

448
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:18,356
The hat part would be appropriate.

449
00:25:18,381 --> 00:25:19,693
Then the hat part

450
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:23,220
would be good to be arranged so that the gaze can continue.

451
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:27,440
Then we need to check if there's any other gaze.

452
00:25:27,465 --> 00:25:29,180
If the main gaze is on this side,

453
00:25:29,182 --> 00:25:31,897
what are the sub-gaze and sub elements like?

454
00:25:31,974 --> 00:25:33,632
We may look at the hands.

455
00:25:33,892 --> 00:25:35,515
If you look at this hand,

456
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:39,289
the face and hands are kind of loose.

457
00:25:39,298 --> 00:25:41,948
I'm going to add some nuance to this,

458
00:25:41,949 --> 00:25:43,303
and edit it later.

459
00:25:45,112 --> 00:25:48,466
So when I change to a cute image or a calm image,

460
00:25:48,467 --> 00:25:50,427
I'm going to edit it once in a while.

461
00:25:50,452 --> 00:25:51,897
I'll leave this section.

462
00:25:51,922 --> 00:25:53,790
First of all, the overall wide gaze composition,

463
00:25:53,815 --> 00:25:55,021
it's spinning this much.

464
00:25:55,046 --> 00:25:57,120
And the subject is clearly visible.

465
00:25:57,202 --> 00:26:00,490
We've achieved the part where we can see the sub element.

466
00:26:00,522 --> 00:26:02,770
This, for an illustration sketch,

467
00:26:02,788 --> 00:26:05,318
we've achieved most of the things we need.

468
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,155
So far we went through the first sketch.

469
00:26:09,893 --> 00:26:13,754
If you just look at it as an example, it might seem difficult.

470
00:26:14,795 --> 00:26:17,832
But actually, the thumbnail part

471
00:26:17,912 --> 00:26:23,690
is the foundation that will be the main focus of the future work,

472
00:26:23,691 --> 00:26:28,246
it's actually at the stage of completing the painting.

473
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,892
So I said we need to anticipate the color at this point.

474
00:26:30,917 --> 00:26:34,367
So I'm drawing at the level

475
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,392
of perfection in my head.

476
00:26:36,239 --> 00:26:38,148
By working on it like that,

477
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:43,416
I think the accuracy of the work will be improved a lot.

478
00:26:45,993 --> 00:26:48,514
And the ability to draw as you intended later on,

479
00:26:49,178 --> 00:26:52,279
the one that we focused on at the beginning of the class,

480
00:26:52,304 --> 00:26:55,197
we'll be able to keep the content to a certain extent.

481
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:58,446
If you think the thumbnail is difficult,

482
00:26:58,471 --> 00:26:59,684
it is alright right now.

483
00:26:59,709 --> 00:27:01,499
As I said before,

484
00:27:01,524 --> 00:27:04,533
you can improve while referring to the materials as much as possible.

485
00:27:07,287 --> 00:27:08,841
Let's say there's this kind of reference,

486
00:27:08,842 --> 00:27:11,129
try to use its pose as much as possible.

487
00:27:11,305 --> 00:27:12,758
It's okay to start with.

488
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,628
So by increasing the information like that,

489
00:27:14,629 --> 00:27:17,095
if you make those yours later on, that's good enough.

490
00:27:18,393 --> 00:27:20,133
So at this stage,

491
00:27:20,158 --> 00:27:22,342
try to draw with

492
00:27:22,482 --> 00:27:23,776
as many references as possible.

493
00:27:23,801 --> 00:27:25,932
If you're struggling, you can do that.

494
00:27:26,114 --> 00:27:28,090
Since we made the first composition like this,

495
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,713
we'll move on to the second composition.

496
00:27:29,921 --> 00:27:31,980
In the first illustration,

497
00:27:31,997 --> 00:27:34,227
I wanted to express the face of the character strongly.

498
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:35,844
Then what should we do for the second round?

499
00:27:35,893 --> 00:27:38,314
The creature in the back is crushed.

500
00:27:38,315 --> 00:27:39,402
In the illustration composition,

501
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,167
could we express more of that part?

502
00:27:41,168 --> 00:27:42,342
In the composition itself?

503
00:27:42,352 --> 00:27:43,594
Let's think about it.

504
00:27:45,002 --> 00:27:46,508
Horizontal and vertical, wide.

505
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,552
Let's go through this part before we move on.

506
00:27:48,745 --> 00:27:50,720
Horizontal and vertical wide.

507
00:27:51,007 --> 00:27:53,464
You might ask what the difference is between them.

508
00:27:54,062 --> 00:27:56,799
Usually, vertically long illustrations like this,

509
00:27:57,006 --> 00:27:58,699
or horizontally long illustrations,

510
00:27:58,925 --> 00:28:01,106
have one side of the screen narrow,

511
00:28:01,131 --> 00:28:03,097
these two sides narrow.

512
00:28:03,291 --> 00:28:06,730
Since it's narrow, it feels kind of stuffy.

513
00:28:07,803 --> 00:28:09,630
Stuffy means,

514
00:28:09,655 --> 00:28:12,017
on the other hand, it means you can concentrate.

515
00:28:14,378 --> 00:28:15,692
You can focus more.

516
00:28:15,912 --> 00:28:19,233
So if you want to show your character strongly,

517
00:28:19,234 --> 00:28:20,847
when you express the illustration,

518
00:28:20,848 --> 00:28:23,636
compared to the cuboid,

519
00:28:23,694 --> 00:28:25,817
the screen that's long vertically or horizontally

520
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:27,410
has a lot of advantages.

521
00:28:30,116 --> 00:28:31,986
Before composing the second screen,

522
00:28:32,011 --> 00:28:33,660
let's talk about some theory.

523
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:36,809
We've talked about the gaze before.

524
00:28:36,834 --> 00:28:38,351
Let's review it a little bit.

525
00:28:38,545 --> 00:28:41,615
Whether the overall composition of the screen should be triangular,

526
00:28:42,315 --> 00:28:43,801
or a diamond shape,

527
00:28:45,488 --> 00:28:46,898
or an 8-shaped composition,

528
00:28:47,906 --> 00:28:49,580
or an inverted triangle...

529
00:28:51,443 --> 00:28:52,542
depending on these things,

530
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:56,306
you can express the character's feelings in a very different way.

531
00:28:56,413 --> 00:28:58,678
We learned these things in the previous silhouette class.

532
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:01,449
We handled it in the gaze processing part.

533
00:29:01,474 --> 00:29:03,197
In making good use of it,

534
00:29:03,222 --> 00:29:05,272
although it was about drawing,

535
00:29:05,297 --> 00:29:08,366
you need to know that lighting is also available.

536
00:29:08,368 --> 00:29:10,075
As I said before,

537
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,351
at the thumbnail level,

538
00:29:11,352 --> 00:29:13,109
you have to anticipate the coloring while working on it.

539
00:29:13,135 --> 00:29:14,723
I do emphasize it once again.

540
00:29:15,692 --> 00:29:16,983
Because

541
00:29:16,985 --> 00:29:18,415
for this one, the lighting

542
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,697
is applied a little bit to the illustration.

543
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,085
Let's make it.

544
00:29:22,292 --> 00:29:23,822
The second thumbnail is,

545
00:29:25,187 --> 00:29:26,352
as I said before,

546
00:29:26,353 --> 00:29:28,688
I'll go for the composition where you can see the creature.

547
00:29:28,803 --> 00:29:32,502
The ratio between the character and the creature is about 7:3.

548
00:29:32,527 --> 00:29:35,466
The character is the main element.

549
00:29:40,602 --> 00:29:43,926
First, I'm going to lay down the character.

550
00:29:45,087 --> 00:29:47,690
The reason why I put it on a horizontally wide screen is,

551
00:29:47,715 --> 00:29:49,508
usually, vertical wide,

552
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:53,418
when there's a character in it,

553
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:55,558
with less of an element,

554
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:57,045
vertical wide is good for composition.

555
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,203
If there's a lot to put in,

556
00:29:58,228 --> 00:29:59,654
and you think you prepared a lot,

557
00:29:59,655 --> 00:30:01,983
horizontal wide is more useful.

558
00:30:02,314 --> 00:30:03,431
Since we have to show the unique personality

559
00:30:03,432 --> 00:30:05,912
of the characters and the things on the character's back,

560
00:30:06,344 --> 00:30:07,878
to a certain extent,

561
00:30:08,425 --> 00:30:11,336
I think we need to show the character part horizontally.

562
00:30:29,685 --> 00:30:32,312
If the main element is the creature in the back,

563
00:30:32,313 --> 00:30:34,568
the sub element will be a character.

564
00:30:34,797 --> 00:30:38,814
Especially the shoulders and neck of the character.

565
00:30:38,889 --> 00:30:42,813
I'd like to make a composition that shows the core of this design.

566
00:31:07,815 --> 00:31:11,423
So it'd be good if you can express the face in detail.

567
00:31:16,097 --> 00:31:18,167
Get the shape of the hair.

568
00:31:20,914 --> 00:31:24,030
It's not that we're going to match the body exactly.

569
00:31:24,396 --> 00:31:27,321
Let's focus on getting the vibe.

570
00:31:30,912 --> 00:31:32,703
Hold it like this...

571
00:31:34,027 --> 00:31:36,297
it's okay to lower this shoulder.

572
00:31:41,984 --> 00:31:44,042
While filming the video,

573
00:31:44,043 --> 00:31:47,370
it's not easy to come up with the composition.

574
00:31:54,721 --> 00:31:58,408
Since you are drawing less nervously than I am,

575
00:31:58,689 --> 00:32:01,548
I hope everyone is enjoying it.

576
00:32:15,393 --> 00:32:18,059
For those of who find the thumbnail difficult,

577
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:20,012
it's okay, it is hard.

578
00:32:20,013 --> 00:32:22,752
This is the most important part of the illustration.

579
00:32:22,999 --> 00:32:27,429
And this is the hardest part of the illustration.

580
00:32:28,095 --> 00:32:31,210
It's hard to compose the screen.

581
00:32:31,496 --> 00:32:32,918
Now, we're drawing this one

582
00:32:34,373 --> 00:32:37,584
while thinking about what we learned earlier,

583
00:32:37,586 --> 00:32:38,799
so of course, it must be hard.

584
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:42,057
Anyway, it is indeed hard.

585
00:32:42,082 --> 00:32:44,035
So it's better to go in without being nervous.

586
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:46,492
This is also my theory of painting.

587
00:32:48,093 --> 00:32:51,560
If you are working on a hard one, you have to take it easy.

588
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:53,331
And the easier it is,

589
00:32:53,332 --> 00:32:55,533
the more serious you should take it.

590
00:32:55,818 --> 00:32:58,324
Most of the time, it's the basics that might bother you later.

591
00:32:58,737 --> 00:33:01,007
One of the things that professionals feel the most is

592
00:33:01,308 --> 00:33:04,035
that they lack some basic skills.

593
00:33:04,037 --> 00:33:05,348
There are a lot of people like this.

594
00:33:05,373 --> 00:33:08,369
When students hear that,

595
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:10,615
you may think they are good at drawing and wonder why they think so.

596
00:33:10,683 --> 00:33:12,700
Actually, they really mean it.

597
00:33:17,498 --> 00:33:19,612
I've seen someone

598
00:33:19,613 --> 00:33:20,915
who wanted to learn shading and sketching again.

599
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,446
The reason I'm saying this is because

600
00:33:27,733 --> 00:33:30,721
although the thumbnail we're working on right now is very difficult,

601
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:31,975
that doesn't mean

602
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,730
this character

603
00:33:33,755 --> 00:33:36,599
looks too jarring.

604
00:33:38,796 --> 00:33:40,118
If you think of it simply,

605
00:33:40,196 --> 00:33:43,252
if there's a point that you want to show,

606
00:33:43,277 --> 00:33:46,196
you can organize it to be captured on the screen.

607
00:33:46,377 --> 00:33:48,406
The method doesn't really matter.

608
00:33:48,833 --> 00:33:51,139
Whether the character is lying down horizontally like now,

609
00:33:51,164 --> 00:33:53,172
or to show the creature as strong,

610
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,655
drawing a big creature in the middle,

611
00:33:55,714 --> 00:33:56,950
for example,

612
00:33:56,983 --> 00:33:58,442
on the vertical screen,

613
00:33:58,737 --> 00:34:00,023
the character is standing like this,

614
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:02,862
and like this,

615
00:34:02,863 --> 00:34:05,086
the big creature in the middle,

616
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:07,063
in any way,

617
00:34:07,065 --> 00:34:10,111
if you can see both the creature and the character,

618
00:34:10,136 --> 00:34:12,712
I think it's going to fit the screen.

619
00:34:12,946 --> 00:34:15,712
You just have to think about which screen is the best.

620
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,915
The answer in that process is

621
00:34:19,202 --> 00:34:22,587
on you.

622
00:34:22,605 --> 00:34:24,065
If you say this side looks prettier,

623
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:25,533
then you can work with that.

624
00:34:26,804 --> 00:34:27,947
That itself is

625
00:34:27,948 --> 00:34:31,201
a part where it becomes about the illustrator's identity,

626
00:34:32,294 --> 00:34:34,127
and if you failed,

627
00:34:34,128 --> 00:34:35,576
you could improve yourself by experiencing that failure.

628
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:45,519
Like this, the character is lying down in front of us.

629
00:34:45,832 --> 00:34:50,166
And you want to compose the screen

630
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:52,092
with a big face of the creature in the back.

631
00:34:52,093 --> 00:34:53,894
We predicted

632
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:55,416
how the gaze would flow.

633
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,829
Let's take a look at it.

634
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:01,676
We can make the gaze flow from the character like this.

635
00:35:01,677 --> 00:35:03,869
It's similar to what we did before.

636
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:05,795
Instead, the creativity in the back

637
00:35:05,796 --> 00:35:07,328
supports the gaze.

638
00:35:07,529 --> 00:35:09,103
You'll get it when you draw the outfit later on,

639
00:35:09,128 --> 00:35:10,728
but the line on the outfit,

640
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,962
and the lip line on this side,

641
00:35:12,963 --> 00:35:14,847
with the waistline on the body,

642
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:18,285
and on this side the tooth line's connected.

643
00:35:18,286 --> 00:35:21,296
So the gaze will naturally move from the character

644
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,148
to the creature in the back.

645
00:35:24,149 --> 00:35:26,971
So, the people who observe it,

646
00:35:26,972 --> 00:35:28,469
will be able to see the characters and the creature.

647
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:32,105
You can add a couple tentacles

648
00:35:32,106 --> 00:35:33,709
around this area.

649
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,140
It was a part of the setup as well.

650
00:35:37,575 --> 00:35:39,476
We've done the 2nd sketch.

651
00:35:39,478 --> 00:35:41,872
Let's start with the 3rd sketch.

652
00:35:45,064 --> 00:35:46,843
Usually, in the thumbnail process,

653
00:35:46,861 --> 00:35:49,281
some people make up to six of them.

654
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:52,457
I feel like I don't need to make that much,

655
00:35:52,598 --> 00:35:54,704
but the process itself is fun,

656
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:57,509
and as I said before, I think it's helpful.

657
00:35:59,109 --> 00:36:00,710
In the time I design this,

658
00:36:01,717 --> 00:36:03,203
I don't waste time.

659
00:36:04,148 --> 00:36:07,022
Thumbnail sketches are supposed to be rough anyway.

660
00:36:07,615 --> 00:36:09,739
Compared to completing a sketch,

661
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:11,889
drawing ten thumbnails,

662
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:15,133
should be less time-consuming than doing one completed illustration.

663
00:36:17,528 --> 00:36:20,109
So the amount of studying and the quality of studying you do

664
00:36:20,933 --> 00:36:22,619
is very beneficial.

665
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:25,702
I don't feel like it's a waste to create thumbnails.

666
00:36:25,881 --> 00:36:28,017
So when you practice,

667
00:36:28,111 --> 00:36:31,295
always draw a lot of thumbnails like this.

668
00:36:32,281 --> 00:36:35,231
It would be great if you take your time with it.

669
00:36:39,313 --> 00:36:44,109
To experiencing the values that make up the screen,

670
00:36:44,111 --> 00:36:45,713
which is different from the experience of designing characters,

671
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:49,132
it is best to draw a lot.

672
00:36:51,093 --> 00:36:54,014
It's good to draw as much as possible.

673
00:36:54,015 --> 00:36:56,907
Most instructors would emphasize this,

674
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:00,390
and you might get tired of hearing it so much.

675
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:02,051
Yes, I guess so.

676
00:37:02,052 --> 00:37:04,579
But some may say there's nothing we can do about it.

677
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:07,077
But it's a bit different.

678
00:37:07,078 --> 00:37:09,090
It's important to know

679
00:37:09,092 --> 00:37:12,484
the parts you need to practice often.

680
00:37:13,488 --> 00:37:17,359
We've talked about careers before.

681
00:37:18,206 --> 00:37:19,987
If you want to be a concept artist

682
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:22,125
by becoming good at designing,

683
00:37:23,005 --> 00:37:25,889
or if you intend to draw creative illustrations

684
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:27,891
or draw fan art

685
00:37:28,511 --> 00:37:30,799
by creating fanzines,

686
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:32,666
when it comes to that,

687
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:35,317
you just have to draw what's most important to you.

688
00:37:35,385 --> 00:37:37,999
Because after all, you'll draw everything.

689
00:37:38,693 --> 00:37:40,529
If you draw for the rest of your life,

690
00:37:41,501 --> 00:37:43,346
if drawing is your job,

691
00:37:43,364 --> 00:37:44,932
you're going to draw many different things.

692
00:37:44,957 --> 00:37:47,820
Or, if you want to draw well, even though it's a hobby,

693
00:37:48,001 --> 00:37:50,615
for those who are taking this class,

694
00:37:50,795 --> 00:37:53,618
even if you say it's just as a hobby,

695
00:37:53,619 --> 00:37:56,067
in the end, you're here to draw enthusiastically.

696
00:37:56,068 --> 00:37:58,909
So, you'll continue to draw to a certain extent.

697
00:37:59,426 --> 00:38:02,020
Then, even these people

698
00:38:02,021 --> 00:38:03,449
will draw a lot.

699
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:06,917
But what do you want to do well with drawing?

700
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:10,099
If you want to be good at illustrating, you'd do a lot of thumbnails.

701
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:12,787
If you want to be good at designing,

702
00:38:12,946 --> 00:38:14,659
I think you should draw a lot.

703
00:38:14,847 --> 00:38:16,624
That's why you have to draw a lot.

704
00:38:16,625 --> 00:38:19,005
You might get tired of hearing this again and again,

705
00:38:19,198 --> 00:38:22,233
but, if you know what you need

706
00:38:22,615 --> 00:38:27,006
and if you focus on that part while you practice,

707
00:38:27,016 --> 00:38:29,224
I think your burden will be relieved.

708
00:38:30,304 --> 00:38:32,408
Of course, you might want to be good at both.

709
00:38:33,196 --> 00:38:34,865
All artists have this desire.

710
00:38:34,866 --> 00:38:36,286
And you have to do both a lot.

711
00:38:48,336 --> 00:38:51,600
In the second sketch, it's important to draw the proportions.

712
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,794
In the rough draft stage,

713
00:38:55,915 --> 00:38:58,513
I drew the basic shape of the upper body,

714
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,799
so, let's check the perspective.

715
00:39:00,824 --> 00:39:02,819
I'm going to stretch out this arm a little bit.

716
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,718
Stretch this arm down like this.

717
00:39:08,999 --> 00:39:11,642
I'm going to lower the character's arms to the front.

718
00:39:12,176 --> 00:39:13,216
Basic type.

719
00:39:19,583 --> 00:39:22,744
Pull out its upper body like this.

720
00:39:22,745 --> 00:39:24,625
Remember the contrapposto of the human body?

721
00:39:26,004 --> 00:39:29,053
When the upper body is pushed forward,

722
00:39:29,054 --> 00:39:30,701
the butt will go backwards.

723
00:39:38,196 --> 00:39:40,109
I'll turn its back here.

724
00:39:44,497 --> 00:39:45,999
So that you can see its belly.

725
00:39:48,494 --> 00:39:49,807
Turn the upper body

726
00:39:50,795 --> 00:39:52,826
and pull out the legs like this.

727
00:40:07,791 --> 00:40:11,193
If the 2nd sketch is set, then I'll move on to the 3rd sketch.

728
00:40:11,602 --> 00:40:14,503
Let's go into the outfit sketch part.

729
00:40:35,256 --> 00:40:38,811
Fix the parts where the eyes were a bit awkward at this stage.

730
00:40:41,235 --> 00:40:43,136
I get a lot of questions about this part.

731
00:40:43,137 --> 00:40:46,591
Students ask if it is okay to draw the eyeball

732
00:40:47,126 --> 00:40:48,885
spreading out when they're drawing this angle.

733
00:40:48,886 --> 00:40:50,519
Actually, this is wrong.

734
00:40:50,535 --> 00:40:53,631
If I were to draw it in this angle,

735
00:40:53,632 --> 00:40:55,949
even if it's widened, it's widened like this.

736
00:40:56,768 --> 00:40:58,229
If you widen it outwards, it's widened outwards.

737
00:40:58,229 --> 00:41:00,073
To be honest, widening it up like this

738
00:41:00,074 --> 00:41:04,583
is not a stable way to draw the front angle.

739
00:41:04,825 --> 00:41:07,546
But this makes you focus more on the face.

740
00:41:07,547 --> 00:41:10,515
And the chin will look thin, so it looks pretty.

741
00:41:10,795 --> 00:41:14,201
So, it's very dangerous to use this.

742
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:16,694
There's a high risk,

743
00:41:16,695 --> 00:41:18,868
but your character will be prettier.

744
00:41:18,869 --> 00:41:21,881
You can decide whether to use it or not.

745
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,974
If you want it to look pretty even if it's a bit risky,

746
00:41:24,975 --> 00:41:27,272
even if the perspective isn't correct,

747
00:41:27,289 --> 00:41:30,115
if you just want to focus on making it look pretty,

748
00:41:30,116 --> 00:41:31,635
you can draw it like this.

749
00:41:31,995 --> 00:41:35,025
For those who want to increase the accuracy,

750
00:41:35,423 --> 00:41:37,399
don't widen both eyes like this.

751
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,398
Draw it in a straight line.

752
00:41:42,968 --> 00:41:45,222
Either way, there are pros and cons.

753
00:41:45,396 --> 00:41:48,673
So, you must plan your drawing as you wish.

754
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:02,224
The pictures we drew in our heads are always the best.

755
00:42:25,496 --> 00:42:27,305
This arm goes forward...

756
00:42:31,805 --> 00:42:34,104
I'll add something fun to it.

757
00:42:55,583 --> 00:42:58,911
Like we did before, we put in the design of its outfits.

758
00:43:02,088 --> 00:43:04,324
We can draw things like the hair that falls back.

759
00:43:05,203 --> 00:43:07,398
Let's depict them and continue.

760
00:43:08,635 --> 00:43:10,796
After that, you always have to check it once more.

761
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:13,602
Once the overall sketch is finished,

762
00:43:13,811 --> 00:43:15,693
we need to check it once at that stage.

763
00:43:16,406 --> 00:43:19,508
You need to see if the parts you wanted to express were in order.

764
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:20,985
That's the most important thing.

765
00:43:21,829 --> 00:43:23,581
What did I want to show here?

766
00:43:23,581 --> 00:43:26,428
I wanted to show the character and the creature at the back at the same time.

767
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:28,609
I think we can see them at the same time.

768
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:31,086
But, I want to show the character first.

769
00:43:31,087 --> 00:43:32,488
I want the viewers to look at the character first

770
00:43:32,489 --> 00:43:33,986
and look at the creature after that.

771
00:43:34,936 --> 00:43:36,358
So, I composed it so that we look at the creature after

772
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:37,918
we see the character.

773
00:43:38,626 --> 00:43:40,814
The gaze includes that concept too.

774
00:43:40,823 --> 00:43:43,321
I'm sure you've learned it in the previous lecture on gazes.

775
00:43:43,444 --> 00:43:44,877
Because people's gaze flows

776
00:43:44,878 --> 00:43:46,585
from top left to bottom right,

777
00:43:46,586 --> 00:43:48,131
the viewers will see the character first.

778
00:43:55,901 --> 00:43:59,400
And this is my own checklist, but,

779
00:43:59,621 --> 00:44:02,498
I look at whether I can change the nuance of the character.

780
00:44:03,415 --> 00:44:06,105
I think this character's nuance can be changed, too.

781
00:44:06,733 --> 00:44:09,296
Of course, the left thumbnail looks simple to modify

782
00:44:09,297 --> 00:44:12,410
so, I think I'll work with the thumbnail on the left.

783
00:44:13,532 --> 00:44:16,651
I think we can change the nuance of this character.

784
00:44:36,494 --> 00:44:37,910
I'll draw a wand, too.

785
00:44:48,097 --> 00:44:50,019
And we should check the most important things.

786
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,096
Does it look pretty?

787
00:44:51,299 --> 00:44:54,019
There might be mixed opinions about this,

788
00:44:54,126 --> 00:44:56,494
but, it's important that

789
00:44:56,495 --> 00:44:58,747
the illustration looks pretty to some extent.

790
00:44:58,748 --> 00:45:01,117
So, when you make the actual thumbnail,

791
00:45:01,118 --> 00:45:03,040
you need to focus on whether it's pretty.

792
00:45:03,041 --> 00:45:04,713
You have to keep thinking about it.

793
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:08,565
If I were to come up with another canvas,

794
00:45:08,565 --> 00:45:10,095
for this character,

795
00:45:10,206 --> 00:45:12,193
I could draw a version that's lying down.

796
00:45:12,298 --> 00:45:14,093
I'll work with this character now.

797
00:45:14,094 --> 00:45:15,429
Since the clothing of the shoulder area is hollowed out,

798
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:18,421
I think the character's back would look pretty.

799
00:45:18,681 --> 00:45:20,387
So, I'll change the outfit design.

800
00:45:22,434 --> 00:45:24,113
Like this.

801
00:45:39,732 --> 00:45:42,212
It can be an illustration that shows the character's back.

802
00:45:45,184 --> 00:45:47,085
I can show the character's personality.

803
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:49,113
I'll raise the legs like this

804
00:45:49,703 --> 00:45:51,575
and stir them in the air.

805
00:46:01,877 --> 00:46:03,574
I'll put the hair down like this.

806
00:46:07,795 --> 00:46:10,693
I'll draw the hat, but I'll give up the teeth of the hat.

807
00:46:11,752 --> 00:46:13,685
Now, I'm going to draw a creature here.

808
00:46:17,543 --> 00:46:19,093
As expected, with the character's face,

809
00:46:19,094 --> 00:46:20,952
so that when your gaze flows, it will reach here,

810
00:46:21,331 --> 00:46:23,521
I'll draw the water on the floor.

811
00:46:23,522 --> 00:46:25,235
Remember this character is from the deep sea?

812
00:46:25,601 --> 00:46:28,575
So, I'll add in elements from the deep sea.

813
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:31,730
I'll draw the wand here.

814
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:34,208
I'll put snacks around it

815
00:46:34,592 --> 00:46:36,603
to show the character's personality.

816
00:46:36,982 --> 00:46:40,195
Or, from the hat,

817
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:44,411
I can use decorations to fill in the space here.

818
00:46:45,484 --> 00:46:47,932
How can I compose differently?

819
00:46:49,207 --> 00:46:52,728
If you want to make this character look charming,

820
00:46:53,028 --> 00:46:56,003
and just want to see the character,

821
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:57,996
if you think that way,

822
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:11,106
this time, the character should be trapped in the canvas.

823
00:47:11,108 --> 00:47:12,528
The top and bottom are cut off.

824
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:14,715
If you look at this one, the top and bottom are also cut off.

825
00:47:14,821 --> 00:47:18,300
It's a composition that increases your concentration.

826
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:20,620
To put it the other way around,

827
00:47:20,621 --> 00:47:23,006
you can't really see the design.

828
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:25,782
So, if the canvas is wide, that's the downside.

829
00:47:25,783 --> 00:47:27,460
You won't recognize the design.

830
00:47:27,791 --> 00:47:29,221
Just the first impression.

831
00:47:29,515 --> 00:47:32,016
The overall image can be conveyed strongly.

832
00:47:32,017 --> 00:47:33,197
That's how it works.

833
00:47:34,316 --> 00:47:36,961
On the other hand, if the whole body of the character is shown on the screen,

834
00:47:36,962 --> 00:47:38,979
The canvas might be a little boring.

835
00:47:39,297 --> 00:47:41,234
The viewers would lose concentration a little bit

836
00:47:41,412 --> 00:47:43,894
but, the design of the character will be very visible.

837
00:47:52,885 --> 00:47:54,598
The teeth area

838
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:56,836
is an area that catches people's attention.

839
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,818
This time, I'm going to take out the teeth.

840
00:48:11,977 --> 00:48:13,509
Instead, for the neck area,

841
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:15,447
I'll make the character's fingers rest on its clothes

842
00:48:24,087 --> 00:48:27,546
to show the design of the outfit

843
00:48:27,547 --> 00:48:28,557
more effectively.

844
00:48:28,915 --> 00:48:30,322
Let's shrink it a little bit

845
00:48:57,289 --> 00:48:59,503
By stretching the legs out in front of the screen,

846
00:49:01,103 --> 00:49:02,657
with the knees out,

847
00:49:03,824 --> 00:49:06,645
afterward, by applying Gaussian blur here,

848
00:49:10,582 --> 00:49:12,878
the Blur effect on the filter tab,

849
00:49:12,879 --> 00:49:15,208
if you click here, there are many blurring effects.

850
00:49:17,191 --> 00:49:18,817
It's called Lens Blur.

851
00:49:19,064 --> 00:49:21,799
This blur is applied to the object that's protruded.

852
00:49:21,905 --> 00:49:23,710
You can blur it out like this.

853
00:49:26,469 --> 00:49:27,744
A wand here.

854
00:49:33,623 --> 00:49:34,843
And a creature in the back.

855
00:49:37,961 --> 00:49:40,500
I forgot to draw the tentacles of this one.

856
00:49:48,465 --> 00:49:51,549
If it goes in and wraps the character's body like this,

857
00:49:54,404 --> 00:49:56,441
it'll help the drawing.

858
00:50:08,009 --> 00:50:10,157
The character's face

859
00:50:10,158 --> 00:50:13,539
may be less emphasized than before,

860
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:16,394
but instead, it focuses more on the body of the character.

861
00:50:16,798 --> 00:50:20,888
So it shows the part that you intended.

862
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:22,504
On the premise that,

863
00:50:22,505 --> 00:50:25,651
in the thumbnail stage you can make up a variety of screens.

864
00:50:26,206 --> 00:50:28,929
After working on the thumbnail to some extent,

865
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:30,806
choose the one you like.

866
00:50:30,807 --> 00:50:32,908
You can proceed with the illustration after.

867
00:50:34,232 --> 00:50:37,951
I think I told you earlier that we need to make plans.

868
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:39,946
How will the background color go in, etc.?

869
00:50:39,947 --> 00:50:42,593
That's what the thumbnail is for.

870
00:50:42,793 --> 00:50:44,858
When I first started...

871
00:50:44,859 --> 00:50:45,918
I told you it's hard.

872
00:50:45,919 --> 00:50:49,717
This is a multi-tasking skill ultimately.

873
00:50:49,718 --> 00:50:52,519
Doing one thing and thinking about many things at the same time,

874
00:50:52,806 --> 00:50:54,176
the more you do that,

875
00:50:54,201 --> 00:50:57,807
the better you will perform.

876
00:50:57,870 --> 00:50:59,980
For example, when we learn how to play games,

877
00:50:59,981 --> 00:51:01,849
and if you want to teach a newbie,

878
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:04,948
you can tell them some key functions

879
00:51:04,949 --> 00:51:06,587
like how to move the character

880
00:51:06,588 --> 00:51:09,922
and what keys to press for attacking.

881
00:51:09,923 --> 00:51:12,413
Or, you can tell them the characters' skills.

882
00:51:12,438 --> 00:51:14,381
You could tell them using a certain item

883
00:51:14,406 --> 00:51:15,618
is effective for certain scenarios.

884
00:51:15,643 --> 00:51:16,889
You could even tell them how many stats it uses

885
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:18,567
and how much it can attack an enemy.

886
00:51:18,592 --> 00:51:20,515
You can explain like that, but if you do so,

887
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:21,600
the newbie will stop even before they start playing.

888
00:51:21,671 --> 00:51:23,059
When you start from the beginning,

889
00:51:23,299 --> 00:51:24,443
you just need to focus on one thing.

890
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:27,728
At first, you just need to focus on the sketch.

891
00:51:27,933 --> 00:51:29,534
If you get used to it,

892
00:51:29,535 --> 00:51:32,207
you may start to catch that while playing games,

893
00:51:32,325 --> 00:51:34,364
from a certain point, when you move around,

894
00:51:34,365 --> 00:51:35,910
you don't care much.

895
00:51:36,104 --> 00:51:37,625
You get to move without stuttering.

896
00:51:37,706 --> 00:51:41,072
From a certain point, the 'cooldowns' of the skills that you use,

897
00:51:41,073 --> 00:51:42,095
you'll memorize them.

898
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:43,728
You'll feel it if you've done it before.

899
00:51:43,753 --> 00:51:44,791
If you keep working on it,

900
00:51:44,791 --> 00:51:47,880
You'll grasp the cooldown for a certain skill.

901
00:51:47,905 --> 00:51:49,743
And you'd be correct.

902
00:51:50,016 --> 00:51:52,683
You can also more correctly predict how much in-game money you'd earn.

903
00:51:52,708 --> 00:51:55,098
Eventually, your predictions will be more accurate.

904
00:51:55,123 --> 00:51:57,505
When you get there, you can increase it little by little.

905
00:51:57,798 --> 00:51:59,497
If you don't understand the game well,

906
00:51:59,498 --> 00:52:01,171
it's similar to driving.

907
00:52:01,708 --> 00:52:03,920
I'm sure there are people who haven't driven before,

908
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:05,422
or rode a bicycle,

909
00:52:05,522 --> 00:52:07,517
but in the end, it's about multi-tasking.

910
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:10,560
When you ride a bike,

911
00:52:10,561 --> 00:52:12,764
you are not aware of turning the pedals.

912
00:52:12,931 --> 00:52:14,681
But you probably recognized that when you first rode it.

913
00:52:14,682 --> 00:52:16,383
How you turn the pedal,

914
00:52:16,392 --> 00:52:17,686
and how you hold the handles,

915
00:52:18,034 --> 00:52:20,674
you may recognize these things at first, but you don't later on.

916
00:52:20,675 --> 00:52:22,705
So you can focus on other things,

917
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:24,494
and get used to multi-tasking.

918
00:52:24,519 --> 00:52:25,760
Therefore,

919
00:52:25,833 --> 00:52:27,096
it's all about your experience.

920
00:52:27,198 --> 00:52:28,799
In the end, experience is important.

921
00:52:29,186 --> 00:52:31,716
I made a lot of thumbnails today.

922
00:52:32,062 --> 00:52:36,056
There were two things that I drew in detail.

923
00:52:37,201 --> 00:52:40,064
Later, by using one of these,

924
00:52:40,065 --> 00:52:42,164
I'm going to color it, too.

925
00:52:42,798 --> 00:52:45,876
I hope that the people who are following me try this kind of work.

926
00:52:47,286 --> 00:52:48,811
And if you worked on it already,

927
00:52:48,998 --> 00:52:51,312
I think it's a good idea to work on an illustration later.

928
00:52:51,313 --> 00:52:52,897
What you have to do is just follow along with the class.

929
00:52:54,784 --> 00:52:56,377
Let's make one more thing.

930
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:07,018
Making thumbnails is really fun work for me, too.

931
00:53:09,567 --> 00:53:11,201
Which screen would be good?

932
00:53:11,202 --> 00:53:13,196
The screen where you can show the character's legs would be good.

933
00:53:13,197 --> 00:53:14,217
Let's compose it.

934
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:18,745
Showing the legs,

935
00:53:18,746 --> 00:53:21,021
I want to show something with a dynamic vibe.

936
00:53:23,415 --> 00:53:25,181
The impressions of the characters in the front

937
00:53:25,182 --> 00:53:27,230
were all calm.

938
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:28,900
This time, let's make one

939
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:33,300
which looks very fancy from the viewer's point of view.

940
00:53:33,302 --> 00:53:34,800
Let's work on it.

941
00:53:40,286 --> 00:53:42,797
As expected, I'm going to widen the angle and work on it.

942
00:53:45,605 --> 00:53:46,909
But this time,

943
00:53:47,864 --> 00:53:49,853
I won't apply the angle around the face.

944
00:53:51,266 --> 00:53:52,808
Instead, I'll apply it around the legs.

945
00:53:56,305 --> 00:53:59,455
I applied a low angle from the face to the neck.

946
00:54:07,205 --> 00:54:08,860
I'll reduce the size a bit.

947
00:54:14,609 --> 00:54:16,124
I'll bend its back, and

948
00:55:25,427 --> 00:55:28,302
I'm going to make the character's expression a bit weaker.

949
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:34,096
I'm going to show you the creature in the back, too.

950
00:55:35,429 --> 00:55:36,545
Now, once more.

951
00:55:36,546 --> 00:55:37,796
The canvas isn't recognizable.

952
00:55:37,798 --> 00:55:39,248
Let's move on to the 2nd sketch.

953
00:55:41,099 --> 00:55:43,698
Let's mix the 2nd and 3rd sketches and continue.

954
00:55:51,481 --> 00:55:53,590
If you're confident in drawing,

955
00:55:53,591 --> 00:55:54,622
you can do that.

956
00:55:54,883 --> 00:55:56,184
Normally,

957
00:55:56,185 --> 00:55:58,289
I separate the second and third stages of sketching.

958
00:56:24,174 --> 00:56:27,025
I also want to keep the sharp teeth if possible.

959
00:57:37,708 --> 00:57:39,945
I'll draw the shoulders like this,

960
00:57:42,013 --> 00:57:44,188
and make this arm droop.

961
00:57:45,194 --> 00:57:48,042
So, as an element that draws the attention down,

962
00:57:48,043 --> 00:57:49,667
I'm going to use this arm here.

963
00:57:50,719 --> 00:57:53,084
Overall, I'll utilize the gaze that droops down

964
00:57:53,085 --> 00:57:54,169
in many ways.

965
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:55,778
It gives a calm impression, and

966
00:57:55,779 --> 00:57:56,996
I'll raise its legs up

967
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:58,902
to emphasize the legs.

968
00:58:13,414 --> 00:58:15,908
When the legs are folded like this,

969
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:19,799
they come up to the shoulders from the upper body.

970
00:58:19,999 --> 00:58:21,978
The length from the belly button to the end of the neck

971
00:58:21,979 --> 00:58:24,539
would be its length.

972
00:58:49,274 --> 00:58:51,643
You won't be able to see the creature in the back.

973
00:58:51,909 --> 00:58:54,398
I think only its tentacle will be shown.

974
00:58:59,131 --> 00:59:02,210
My key point was to show the character and its legs.

975
00:59:05,232 --> 00:59:07,820
We learned how to compose the canvas

976
00:59:07,821 --> 00:59:10,053
depending on what you want to show.

977
00:59:10,054 --> 00:59:11,544
Besides this,

978
00:59:11,545 --> 00:59:14,053
there's a lot of things you would want to show.

979
00:59:14,205 --> 00:59:16,082
You might want to show the character's design.

980
00:59:16,084 --> 00:59:17,677
It could be something like this,

981
00:59:17,702 --> 00:59:19,616
but it could also be the character's setting.

982
00:59:19,641 --> 00:59:22,622
For example, this character's hat has teeth.

983
00:59:22,816 --> 00:59:25,812
If you wanted to make this character cute,

984
00:59:25,837 --> 00:59:28,045
I would have drawn this character like that.

985
00:59:28,047 --> 00:59:30,942
If the hat moves like a human being,

986
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:32,958
it could try to eat up the character's head.

987
00:59:33,417 --> 00:59:35,560
It could be a bit scary,

988
00:59:35,561 --> 00:59:39,060
but if you make it funny,

989
00:59:39,109 --> 00:59:41,712
it's also possible to create a cute character.

990
00:59:42,346 --> 00:59:45,266
That's how you can change its settings.

991
00:59:45,267 --> 00:59:47,678
Depending on the feeling that you want to express.

992
00:59:48,606 --> 00:59:51,110
Of course, today

993
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:55,703
we made a simple canvas because

994
00:59:55,705 --> 00:59:59,902
then it's easier to use this to change the atmosphere.

995
00:59:59,903 --> 01:00:02,923
If you want to draw with your own character,

996
01:00:02,924 --> 01:00:04,859
if that's the only goal,

997
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:08,079
I hope you can set it in many different situations.

998
01:00:10,208 --> 01:00:11,478
I organized it like this, and

999
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,594
I'm going to add a fun device.

1000
01:00:23,896 --> 01:00:25,529
It's an upside down canvas.

1001
01:00:25,685 --> 01:00:27,295
A canvas that's flipped like this

1002
01:00:27,296 --> 01:00:30,023
makes it hard to recognize the characters.

1003
01:00:30,310 --> 01:00:32,855
But, the character's appeal becomes stronger.

1004
01:00:37,619 --> 01:00:38,995
So I'm going to use this

1005
01:00:38,996 --> 01:00:41,831
to make the character's first impression strong.

1006
01:00:44,215 --> 01:00:47,210
Like a character trapped in a box,

1007
01:00:50,786 --> 01:00:52,874
it's also possible to compose it like this.

1008
01:00:57,198 --> 01:00:59,515
I'm sure you've grasped it by now.

1009
01:00:59,685 --> 01:01:02,405
It's going to be a gaze that turns around intensively.

1010
01:01:03,105 --> 01:01:05,642
So, by look at a lot of gazes,

1011
01:01:05,644 --> 01:01:07,606
and composing many different screens,

1012
01:01:07,623 --> 01:01:09,488
or applying various situations,

1013
01:01:09,489 --> 01:01:11,655
it's important to keep focusing

1014
01:01:11,656 --> 01:01:13,657
on expressing what you wanted.

1015
01:01:14,293 --> 01:01:16,643
We've done many different thumbnails today.

1016
01:01:16,645 --> 01:01:18,103
Let's have some time to organize things.

1017
01:01:27,656 --> 01:01:31,501
Thumbnail means

1018
01:01:31,502 --> 01:01:32,560
a drawing the size of a thumbnail.

1019
01:01:32,561 --> 01:01:35,615
So in the thumbnail sketch, it's important to focus

1020
01:01:35,616 --> 01:01:38,388
on the feeling that you've been thinking of

1021
01:01:38,389 --> 01:01:40,219
after making sketches fast.

1022
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:41,803
Just to match the body,

1023
01:01:41,803 --> 01:01:44,342
if you spend 30 to 40 minutes on the thumbnail sketch,

1024
01:01:44,343 --> 01:01:46,506
it's going to be hard to work on afterward.

1025
01:01:46,531 --> 01:01:48,305
Although I said 15 seconds,

1026
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:50,365
at first, if it takes 10 to 20 minutes,

1027
01:01:50,365 --> 01:01:51,638
that would be enough.

1028
01:01:51,738 --> 01:01:54,295
It's good enough to reduce it by up to 20 minutes.

1029
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:55,349
Therefore,

1030
01:01:55,349 --> 01:01:57,836
focus on getting the thumbnail.

1031
01:01:57,837 --> 01:01:59,480
And try to compose a variety of screens.

1032
01:01:59,481 --> 01:02:01,433
If you have one that you like,

1033
01:02:01,434 --> 01:02:03,898
moving on to the 2nd and 3rd sketches,

1034
01:02:03,899 --> 01:02:06,767
anticipate the coloring stage

1035
01:02:06,823 --> 01:02:08,307
to the final stage.

1036
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:10,203
It's going to be a great study method.

1037
01:02:10,204 --> 01:02:12,935
For those who want to work in the illustration field,

1038
01:02:12,936 --> 01:02:16,063
I recommend you go through this process a lot.

1039
01:02:16,064 --> 01:02:17,443
Next time, I'll use this one

1040
01:02:17,444 --> 01:02:19,218
to work on the illustration.

1041
01:02:19,519 --> 01:02:21,791
I'll think about what to choose.

1042
01:02:22,191 --> 01:02:24,435
I'll wrap up today's class now.

1043
01:02:24,701 --> 01:02:25,788
See you in the next lecture.
