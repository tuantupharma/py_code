00:00:06,377 --> 00:00:07,326
Hello.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,603
I dubbed in today's lecture

4
00:00:09,627 --> 00:00:10,757
after recording it.

5
00:00:11,946 --> 00:00:15,282
Previously, when I described full illustrations,

6
00:00:15,468 --> 00:00:17,962
to show you a lot of descriptions,

7
00:00:17,987 --> 00:00:19,393
I thought it wasn't enough

8
00:00:19,417 --> 00:00:21,094
within the limited time of an hour.

9
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:24,868
Actually, this video was for 2 hours.

10
00:00:24,893 --> 00:00:26,340
But I doubled the speed.

11
00:00:26,365 --> 00:00:28,912
The current video is dubbed.

12
00:00:28,937 --> 00:00:31,256
I added my voice to it to match the runtime.

13
00:00:31,536 --> 00:00:35,167
If you want to see the descriptions at normal speed,

14
00:00:35,192 --> 00:00:38,696
you can play this video at 0.5 times speed.

15
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,575
If you turn off the sound and play it at 0.5x speed,

16
00:00:41,599 --> 00:00:43,383
you can see the video

17
00:00:43,407 --> 00:00:45,006
at my normal work pace.

18
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,945
If you want to use it when you study, you can watch it like that.

19
00:00:48,275 --> 00:00:49,597
Today,

20
00:00:49,621 --> 00:00:52,900
with the portrait illustration that I worked on,

21
00:00:52,902 --> 00:00:54,256
I'm going to add details to it.

22
00:00:56,228 --> 00:00:59,820
The key to this illustration is to create a sentimental mood.

23
00:00:59,844 --> 00:01:01,840
I think it's better to express this with tertiary colors.

24
00:01:01,842 --> 00:01:03,171
That's going to be the key.

25
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,288
So that the overall contrast is not too strong,

26
00:01:05,312 --> 00:01:06,983
it's important to be careful.

27
00:01:07,007 --> 00:01:10,343
Portrait illustration is a standing illustration.

28
00:01:10,367 --> 00:01:13,504
The character itself is the main feature.

29
00:01:13,528 --> 00:01:14,928
Since there's no background,

30
00:01:14,952 --> 00:01:19,219
the character has some dimensional effect.

31
00:01:19,243 --> 00:01:23,125
A Form Shadow will help with the three-dimensional effect.

32
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:24,940
I'll focus more on those parts.

33
00:01:24,964 --> 00:01:26,544
I'm going to make sure I can do the coloring.

34
00:01:27,986 --> 00:01:30,823
Remember Occlusion Shadow?

35
00:01:30,848 --> 00:01:34,525
It shows the parts that are far apart from each other.

36
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:36,845
When you mix the tertiary colors in between,

37
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:38,281
look at it in black and white.

38
00:01:38,305 --> 00:01:40,438
So that there's nothing wrong with the tone.

39
00:01:40,463 --> 00:01:42,202
It's important to move on.

40
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:46,953
I usually use a Hard Brush when I draw.

41
00:01:47,103 --> 00:01:49,988
In this case, for each person who uses it,

42
00:01:50,012 --> 00:01:51,274
it depends on your preference.

43
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,107
I prefer Hard Brushes.

44
00:01:53,132 --> 00:01:54,453
So I use them.

45
00:01:54,477 --> 00:01:55,871
The reason is,

46
00:01:55,896 --> 00:01:57,206
they're sticky.

47
00:01:57,231 --> 00:01:59,796
I only use it like this because I like the sticky feeling.

48
00:01:59,821 --> 00:02:02,000
If you're adding gradation,

49
00:02:02,002 --> 00:02:03,130
since I'm using a Hard Brush,

50
00:02:03,191 --> 00:02:06,466
if it leaves a lot of marks and if it's kind of shabby...

51
00:02:06,886 --> 00:02:09,754
For those who have dirty touches on there,

52
00:02:09,778 --> 00:02:12,302
it's a way to control your touch, but use an Air Brush

53
00:02:12,326 --> 00:02:14,171
to do it more comfortably.

54
00:02:15,532 --> 00:02:17,386
Whatever your process is,

55
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,476
if the results come out well,

56
00:02:19,478 --> 00:02:21,429
it's all good.

57
00:02:22,464 --> 00:02:25,847
You have to keep finding what makes you comfortable.

58
00:02:29,867 --> 00:02:32,662
I'll continue to put in Form Shadow.

59
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:34,405
There's the description.

60
00:02:35,263 --> 00:02:37,218
When describing the hair's texture,

61
00:02:37,243 --> 00:02:38,440
be careful that it doesn't become too regular.

62
00:02:38,442 --> 00:02:40,134
That's the point.

63
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,713
In the worst case scenario,

64
00:02:42,073 --> 00:02:44,730
it comes out regularly.

65
00:02:44,981 --> 00:02:47,566
Hair, or grass,

66
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,310
when you place these natural objects,

67
00:02:50,335 --> 00:02:53,203
please be careful not to make them too regular.

68
00:02:53,779 --> 00:02:55,096
For border colors,

69
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,740
I'm going to make the tertiary color red for the skin.

70
00:02:57,764 --> 00:02:58,936
I placed them.

71
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,001
My character's skin is in a low saturation now,

72
00:03:02,025 --> 00:03:03,425
but since it's skin,

73
00:03:03,427 --> 00:03:05,692
and it has a reddish image,

74
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,536
when I apply the tertiary colors,

75
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,179
I think it's better to apply red more than in other places.

76
00:03:10,204 --> 00:03:12,115
It'll make it look more natural.

77
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,918
For other places,

78
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,901
when you apply tertiary colors,

79
00:03:15,925 --> 00:03:19,922
the bright parts are turquoise or sky blue, which have a high natural brightness.

80
00:03:19,946 --> 00:03:21,495
So these colors are applied.

81
00:03:21,897 --> 00:03:24,874
For the dark areas and the areas that are on the border,

82
00:03:24,898 --> 00:03:28,612
navy and blue which have relatively low-specific brightness.

83
00:03:28,636 --> 00:03:30,951
It would be nice to use these colors.

84
00:03:30,975 --> 00:03:32,626
The same goes for purple.

85
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:42,127
Recently, there are a lot of portrait illustrations.

86
00:03:42,151 --> 00:03:45,613
See "Arknights", "Alchemy Stars", and "Girls' Frontline"

87
00:03:45,637 --> 00:03:48,468
"Azur Lane" and so on, for example.

88
00:03:48,492 --> 00:03:52,709
You'll be able to see them in various games like "Epic Seven".

89
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:55,523
The illustrations from these games

90
00:03:55,547 --> 00:03:57,067
is very different in terms of quality.

91
00:03:57,091 --> 00:04:00,108
And depending on the artist's drawing style,

92
00:04:00,132 --> 00:04:02,132
the style changes a lot.

93
00:04:02,157 --> 00:04:04,357
So, for the description itself,

94
00:04:04,381 --> 00:04:06,124
there's nothing in particular that's decided.

95
00:04:06,148 --> 00:04:09,160
That's true, but later on, people who work on

96
00:04:09,162 --> 00:04:10,560
portrait illustration usually...

97
00:04:10,655 --> 00:04:12,722
In order to be hired later on,

98
00:04:12,926 --> 00:04:15,005
I think you'll have to make a portfolio.

99
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,281
So you can make it and submit it to the company.

100
00:04:18,305 --> 00:04:20,950
Or you can upload it on the internet

101
00:04:20,974 --> 00:04:24,266
to show that you're available for work.

102
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:27,656
So, when I do this kind of illustration for students,

103
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,680
most of the time, I recommend that they describe it a lot

104
00:04:30,682 --> 00:04:31,815
before proceeding with it.

105
00:04:33,082 --> 00:04:35,433
As I said before,

106
00:04:35,457 --> 00:04:37,909
description is not an essential part of drawing.

107
00:04:37,933 --> 00:04:40,566
It's an additional element that decorates the picture.

108
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,474
But to show that I can do various things,

109
00:04:43,498 --> 00:04:44,736
it's meaningful.

110
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:46,665
Don't forget to separate

111
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:48,689
Cast Shadow and Form Shadow.

112
00:04:50,275 --> 00:04:52,275
When you put in Cast Shadow,

113
00:04:52,299 --> 00:04:54,339
make sure it

114
00:04:59,711 --> 00:05:01,905
doesn't get double-layered.

115
00:05:02,277 --> 00:05:04,010
Let's be careful not to use the same color

116
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,356
for the Cast Shadow and Form Shadow.

117
00:05:06,381 --> 00:05:09,517
With the Cast Shadow, which is the shadow between objects,

118
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,266
the contrast is a bit stronger.

119
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,886
You need to add Cast Shadow in a darker tone.

120
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,374
For Form Shadow, it's better to use a brighter tone.

121
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,507
It's more natural.

122
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,046
On the hair side, I'll use Occlusion Shadow.

123
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,992
The sides and front hair clearly show the distance.

124
00:05:28,016 --> 00:05:29,957
Please show clearly

125
00:05:29,982 --> 00:05:31,333
the distribution of these major parts.

126
00:05:32,426 --> 00:05:34,746
And add some texture to it.

127
00:05:35,978 --> 00:05:38,172
I'll add some bangs here and there.

128
00:05:38,197 --> 00:05:40,275
If the hair has irregularity,

129
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:42,312
as I said before, it can be the kind of hair

130
00:05:42,336 --> 00:05:43,893
where it doesn't work out regularly.

131
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:56,087
I'll apply Form Shadow on the edges of the hair.

132
00:05:56,112 --> 00:05:57,270
Now, the Occlusion Shadow is formed around

133
00:05:57,294 --> 00:06:00,215
the hair and the teeth at the back.

134
00:06:01,483 --> 00:06:03,767
Don't forget to put these in.

135
00:06:05,233 --> 00:06:07,445
If possible, when you're doing the description,

136
00:06:07,469 --> 00:06:09,680
just complete it partially.

137
00:06:09,704 --> 00:06:11,336
Before moving on,

138
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,683
let's raise the overall quality.

139
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:16,255
Carve it partially.

140
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:18,622
After doing that,

141
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:21,243
let's take one more time to adjust the overall balance.

142
00:06:21,723 --> 00:06:24,590
After that, let's go through the details.

143
00:06:24,614 --> 00:06:27,889
Then, I'll balance them out.

144
00:06:27,913 --> 00:06:30,011
It's good to repeat the process.

145
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,222
So, now it's done at once.

146
00:06:32,246 --> 00:06:34,668
It's not the end.

147
00:06:34,693 --> 00:06:37,168
Repeat this several times.

148
00:06:37,192 --> 00:06:39,957
Is there anything wrong with your drawing?

149
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:41,363
Check that out.

150
00:06:42,114 --> 00:06:45,364
I used pink for the border of the eye area, too.

151
00:06:45,388 --> 00:06:47,313
There's a lot of blue in the other sections,

152
00:06:47,337 --> 00:06:49,179
so if you use pink,

153
00:06:49,203 --> 00:06:50,888
that part will be the highlight.

154
00:06:51,122 --> 00:06:52,823
The eyes of the character

155
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:55,185
is one of the most important parts.

156
00:06:55,209 --> 00:06:56,874
Pink on the borderline.

157
00:06:57,006 --> 00:06:58,418
I'm going to use cool and warm color contrasts.

158
00:06:58,442 --> 00:07:00,774
I'll make this part the main point.

159
00:07:00,894 --> 00:07:02,487
The highlight of the hair,

160
00:07:02,512 --> 00:07:04,704
I'm going to put it in the middle

161
00:07:04,728 --> 00:07:08,093
since it's the area that receives the most light.

162
00:07:08,117 --> 00:07:11,111
You'll be able to see the part where I'm adding a bit of saturation.

163
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:18,078
If there's an area with low saturation and an area with high saturation,

164
00:07:18,102 --> 00:07:20,367
because it's more important than the other areas,

165
00:07:20,517 --> 00:07:23,198
it will be good to use it as the highlight.

166
00:07:35,287 --> 00:07:36,438
In the description stage,

167
00:07:36,462 --> 00:07:38,884
it takes a lot of time.

168
00:07:38,908 --> 00:07:41,504
It's a part that requires perseverence

169
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:43,127
for the people who work on it.

170
00:07:43,308 --> 00:07:46,234
There's one thing I want to say to you.

171
00:07:46,396 --> 00:07:49,738
For those who haven't described much before,

172
00:07:49,762 --> 00:07:52,292
some people have a hard time

173
00:07:52,316 --> 00:07:54,078
to keep drawing a piece for more than an hour.

174
00:07:54,102 --> 00:07:56,608
For those who especially focus on drawing

175
00:07:56,633 --> 00:07:59,060
and haven't done much coloring,

176
00:07:59,085 --> 00:08:01,999
normally, drawing takes an hour per work even if you draw a lot,

177
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:04,541
so at this stage of description,

178
00:08:04,566 --> 00:08:05,959
I'm sure a lot of people feel that

179
00:08:05,983 --> 00:08:07,702
they are a bit impatient.

180
00:08:08,056 --> 00:08:09,006
There is nothing I can do to help that.

181
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,880
In this case, just work on a piece

182
00:08:11,904 --> 00:08:13,387
for two weeks,

183
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,938
or for 7 hours a day.

184
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:17,918
Hold on to the picture and try your best.

185
00:08:18,236 --> 00:08:20,298
Increase your drawing time,

186
00:08:20,322 --> 00:08:22,287
and it will be good to get used to it.

187
00:08:22,311 --> 00:08:23,952
And when you get used to it,

188
00:08:23,976 --> 00:08:27,071
you can do very detailed work.

189
00:08:27,095 --> 00:08:28,405
Even with something less detailed,

190
00:08:28,429 --> 00:08:30,046
you can draw it much better.

191
00:08:31,363 --> 00:08:32,540
Similar to that,

192
00:08:32,565 --> 00:08:34,368
with drawing, it's kind of one-sided.

193
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,716
There are times when only one side helps.

194
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,179
One of them is to increase the amount of time you're working.

195
00:08:41,122 --> 00:08:43,028
Of course, working on something quickly,

196
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:46,772
it would be nice to get used to that, too.

197
00:08:46,796 --> 00:08:48,796
But you have to try at least once

198
00:08:49,143 --> 00:08:50,739
the process of describing it clearly

199
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:52,211
by increasing your work time.

200
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,837
You should know how to describe things first

201
00:08:55,257 --> 00:08:57,001
and then shorten the time that it takes.

202
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,192
You should learn how to draw faster.

203
00:09:00,942 --> 00:09:02,626
You should try,

204
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:03,852
even with detailed description.

205
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:06,412
For those who draw illustrations for the first time,

206
00:09:06,436 --> 00:09:08,707
there are times when the time spent on one piece

207
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:11,045
takes about a month.

208
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,511
For those who are taking classes,

209
00:09:17,535 --> 00:09:19,260
and getting some feedback,

210
00:09:19,284 --> 00:09:20,907
it will feel like it takes a month.

211
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,614
So, if your hands are too slow when you work,

212
00:09:26,638 --> 00:09:29,372
rather than being sad, work on something more detailed.

213
00:09:29,396 --> 00:09:31,536
It speeds up the drawing process.

214
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:32,852
Please keep that in mind.

215
00:09:41,474 --> 00:09:42,908
If you look at the metal area,

216
00:09:42,932 --> 00:09:45,053
you'll be able to see that the base is dark.

217
00:09:45,077 --> 00:09:47,872
Rather than the white outfits.

218
00:09:47,979 --> 00:09:50,756
It's also the contrast of the metal itself.

219
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,719
It's bigger than the white ones.

220
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:56,826
Comparing materials such as

221
00:09:56,851 --> 00:09:58,382
hair, outfit, and skin,

222
00:09:58,521 --> 00:10:01,045
the contrast is a bit bigger.

223
00:10:01,069 --> 00:10:02,517
Because of the high reflectance,

224
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:04,927
you can see that the base tone is darker

225
00:10:04,951 --> 00:10:07,992
so the part where the light is applied can be brightened up.

226
00:10:10,582 --> 00:10:12,914
I'm going to keep the Occlusion Shadow for the hair.

227
00:10:12,938 --> 00:10:15,300
Occlusion Shadow is excellent for raising the quality.

228
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:16,718
Let's focus on it.

229
00:10:18,256 --> 00:10:19,855
On the back of the hat,

230
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:21,177
I'll add the Form Shadow.

231
00:10:24,397 --> 00:10:25,985
When I do description,

232
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:28,545
I work on it

233
00:10:28,569 --> 00:10:29,771
when it's a bit dark.

234
00:10:30,034 --> 00:10:31,291
What I'm saying is,

235
00:10:31,316 --> 00:10:34,481
I edit it later and use

236
00:10:34,505 --> 00:10:37,006
Overlay or Multiply.

237
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,364
When I work on that,

238
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,444
and if the base tone color is set too high,

239
00:10:40,468 --> 00:10:43,274
there are times when it doesn't match up when you apply it later on.

240
00:10:43,772 --> 00:10:47,217
So to reduce that,

241
00:10:47,623 --> 00:10:50,342
I use a lower tone until the coloring is done.

242
00:10:50,366 --> 00:10:52,075
Let's make it a bit dark.

243
00:10:52,099 --> 00:10:53,809
Later, when editing,

244
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,925
I tend to work on it while

245
00:10:55,949 --> 00:10:57,277
brightening up the dark areas.

246
00:10:59,344 --> 00:11:01,994
Of course, this is the style that I usually work with.

247
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:03,648
It's not fixed.

248
00:11:03,672 --> 00:11:05,266
That was more comfortable for me.

249
00:11:18,953 --> 00:11:21,305
I'm continuing to describe it.

250
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:24,950
In this curriculum,

251
00:11:24,974 --> 00:11:28,223
we learned how to draw characters.

252
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,827
And using that character,

253
00:11:29,851 --> 00:11:31,654
we learned how to organize the screen.

254
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:33,187
And by using it,

255
00:11:33,211 --> 00:11:35,440
we worked on examples of practical illustrations.

256
00:11:35,536 --> 00:11:37,640
We approached it with two examples.

257
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:40,470
Full illustration, and portrait illustration.

258
00:11:41,347 --> 00:11:42,778
In fact, most of the time,

259
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,802
if we continue with this,

260
00:11:44,826 --> 00:11:47,807
I think it's possible

261
00:11:47,831 --> 00:11:48,836
to work in many styles.

262
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,822
That's true, but during this curriculum,

263
00:11:51,846 --> 00:11:54,244
I'm sure there are things that I haven't covered.

264
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:56,534
Of course,

265
00:11:56,558 --> 00:11:59,755
there are 20 chapters

266
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:01,000
in this curriculum.

267
00:12:01,024 --> 00:12:02,880
But, to explain all the theories of drawing,

268
00:12:02,904 --> 00:12:04,497
it's enough time.

269
00:12:04,634 --> 00:12:06,071
So I'm sure there are students

270
00:12:06,096 --> 00:12:08,426
who don't know some parts yet.

271
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:11,083
I'm sure there are some things you want to study more about.

272
00:12:11,317 --> 00:12:13,974
In this video, what I wanted to say the most

273
00:12:13,998 --> 00:12:15,512
to my students is

274
00:12:15,536 --> 00:12:17,604
to have a different perception

275
00:12:17,628 --> 00:12:20,506
about studying.

276
00:12:21,828 --> 00:12:25,025
Especially with drawing studies,

277
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:28,072
it's important that we strengthen our skills.

278
00:12:28,096 --> 00:12:30,545
So, it's important that you draw well in the future.

279
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,409
In a way, what you're good at right now is

280
00:12:32,433 --> 00:12:34,608
not that important.

281
00:12:35,011 --> 00:12:38,382
Of course, if you do it as a hobby, it's different.

282
00:12:38,407 --> 00:12:41,085
But, say you want to be hired to work.

283
00:12:41,109 --> 00:12:42,717
In other words, if you get a job later on,

284
00:12:42,741 --> 00:12:45,053
for those who want to be in outsourcing,

285
00:12:45,077 --> 00:12:47,853
if you look at it,

286
00:12:47,877 --> 00:12:49,608
the time when you first become a professional illustrator

287
00:12:49,633 --> 00:12:52,150
could be the time when you need my skills.

288
00:12:52,174 --> 00:12:54,037
I'm sure your skills will continue to improve after that,

289
00:12:54,061 --> 00:12:56,703
but when you first get your job as a professional,

290
00:12:56,727 --> 00:13:00,810
it would be more practical.

291
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,391
Based on that,

292
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:04,686
drawing is like a long journey in the end.

293
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:07,312
As you're studying illustration in the long run,

294
00:13:07,336 --> 00:13:08,568
you need to change your perception.

295
00:13:08,592 --> 00:13:11,207
You need to know what illustration is all about.

296
00:13:11,231 --> 00:13:14,488
You should know how to use references.

297
00:13:14,513 --> 00:13:18,316
When it comes to composing, find out how it's done.

298
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,540
How would you approach studying anatomy?

299
00:13:21,183 --> 00:13:24,094
How should you approach character design?

300
00:13:24,118 --> 00:13:26,165
Teaching you these approaches

301
00:13:26,189 --> 00:13:27,973
was what I wanted to

302
00:13:27,997 --> 00:13:30,251
include the most in this curriculum.

303
00:13:30,275 --> 00:13:33,899
So, when setting my target audience for this class,

304
00:13:33,923 --> 00:13:37,511
I thought it would be best for novice students to take it.

305
00:13:37,535 --> 00:13:38,791
Of course, the content that's in it

306
00:13:38,815 --> 00:13:40,726
related very much to the actual drawing part.

307
00:13:40,751 --> 00:13:42,937
So it could have been a bit difficult for some of you,

308
00:13:43,183 --> 00:13:45,233
but you don't have to learn everything right away.

309
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:47,457
Based on your long-term goals,

310
00:13:47,481 --> 00:13:49,127
even for those who are drawing for the first time,

311
00:13:49,151 --> 00:13:51,068
when you study drawing,

312
00:13:51,092 --> 00:13:52,703
the things that I told you,

313
00:13:53,524 --> 00:13:55,647
including how to illustrate the human body,

314
00:13:55,671 --> 00:13:57,354
remember these things well

315
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,378
and use them when you practice.

316
00:13:59,402 --> 00:14:00,918
It'll increase the efficiency in the future.

317
00:14:00,942 --> 00:14:02,942
That means that you're strengthening your skills.

318
00:14:02,966 --> 00:14:04,674
When you go along the path as an illustrator,

319
00:14:05,917 --> 00:14:07,828
if you apply the things you learned,

320
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,004
you can make it become some sort of a vehicle.

321
00:14:10,076 --> 00:14:12,463
Rather than walking, it's better to go by car.

322
00:14:12,487 --> 00:14:14,432
It's much faster for when you're going long distances.

323
00:14:30,407 --> 00:14:32,364
Now, for the contrast with the metal,

324
00:14:32,388 --> 00:14:34,388
you can see that I'm painting in big strokes.

325
00:14:38,365 --> 00:14:40,591
It's good to watch carefully

326
00:14:40,615 --> 00:14:41,655
and look at the pictures in small pieces.

327
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:43,620
You should check

328
00:14:43,645 --> 00:14:45,441
if the overall balance is set well.

329
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,335
It's good to either shrink it

330
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,847
or put a small screen on the left side.

331
00:14:51,871 --> 00:14:53,506
That will be good.

332
00:14:53,787 --> 00:14:55,615
The Window menu on the top.

333
00:14:55,692 --> 00:14:56,961
For Photoshop,

334
00:14:56,985 --> 00:14:58,686
if you click [Window],

335
00:14:59,424 --> 00:15:02,700
there will be the [Arrange] menu.

336
00:15:02,724 --> 00:15:04,977
If you go to [Window]-[Arrange],

337
00:15:05,002 --> 00:15:07,081
from there, go to [New Window for..].

338
00:15:07,105 --> 00:15:08,692
It'll be at the bottom like this.

339
00:15:08,716 --> 00:15:10,457
If you press that,

340
00:15:10,481 --> 00:15:12,929
you can see your work

341
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:14,599
in a small size.

342
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:16,877
You can put this on the side.

343
00:15:16,901 --> 00:15:18,506
Or, you can just use the Navigator Tool,

344
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:20,158
which helps you with the overall process.

345
00:15:20,182 --> 00:15:21,774
Personally, I don't really use

346
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:24,016
the Navigator Tool

347
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,435
because there's a square red line.

348
00:15:26,222 --> 00:15:27,905
You can use it according to your preferences.

349
00:15:28,482 --> 00:15:30,681
The teeth also have high contrast, so

350
00:15:30,705 --> 00:15:32,250
I'll add highlights.

351
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:34,990
Let's set the contrast to be

352
00:15:35,014 --> 00:15:36,571
weaker than metal and then apply it.

353
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,108
Actually, today,

354
00:15:41,132 --> 00:15:43,524
because it's actually a 2-hour-long video,

355
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,868
I compressed it and made it into an hour.

356
00:15:45,892 --> 00:15:47,328
It's a 2-hour-long video,

357
00:15:47,352 --> 00:15:49,768
so it's going to be hard to finish the drawing.

358
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:51,515
I won't finish it.

359
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:54,672
This video was produced

360
00:15:54,696 --> 00:15:56,770
to capture the flow of my work,

361
00:15:56,771 --> 00:15:58,019
and to show you how I do description.

362
00:15:58,181 --> 00:16:00,675
As I said before, for description,

363
00:16:00,699 --> 00:16:02,304
there's no specific method.

364
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,569
Until you say it's done,

365
00:16:04,593 --> 00:16:06,511
it's important to keep improving the quality.

366
00:16:06,611 --> 00:16:08,518
In the past, when it came to details,

367
00:16:08,542 --> 00:16:10,934
I heard someone say this...

368
00:16:11,222 --> 00:16:13,854
The details get higher in quality as you invest more time.

369
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:17,550
If I put in 10 hours, the quality will be equal to 10 hours.

370
00:16:17,574 --> 00:16:19,095
If it takes 20 hours, the quality will be equal to 20 hours.

371
00:16:19,119 --> 00:16:20,904
The quality can continue to improve.

372
00:16:21,743 --> 00:16:23,829
But, I'll say that it's not about quality, but completeness.

373
00:16:23,854 --> 00:16:25,621
The level of perfection can go up.

374
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:28,944
But when it comes to drawing, the quality and the completeness...

375
00:16:28,968 --> 00:16:31,240
Some people think they are different.

376
00:16:31,588 --> 00:16:33,488
You might ask what the difference is.

377
00:16:33,512 --> 00:16:35,393
The completeness of the painting is literally

378
00:16:35,417 --> 00:16:38,278
how neat the description is.

379
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,137
The quality of the drawing would be how good the thought process was.

380
00:16:41,241 --> 00:16:43,686
It also means how detailed the composition was.

381
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,567
It's about how eye-catching it is

382
00:16:45,591 --> 00:16:47,424
and how well everything is naturally connected.

383
00:16:47,448 --> 00:16:49,720
In terms of color, the coloring,

384
00:16:49,745 --> 00:16:51,505
the color combination, the lighting

385
00:16:51,529 --> 00:16:54,069
and how it's done, that determines the quality.

386
00:16:54,098 --> 00:16:55,176
That's what I think.

387
00:16:55,326 --> 00:16:57,646
So, what we have to put into the drawing is

388
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,906
supposed to be high quality.

389
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:01,808
If you can raise the quality to a certain extent,

390
00:17:01,832 --> 00:17:03,682
to be honest, completeness

391
00:17:03,706 --> 00:17:06,050
is just about painting it neatly.

392
00:17:06,074 --> 00:17:07,426
Depending on the time spent,

393
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,450
you can consider the results to be a little different.

394
00:17:09,659 --> 00:17:11,290
So, when drawing,

395
00:17:11,314 --> 00:17:12,762
you should invest a lot of time

396
00:17:13,146 --> 00:17:14,664
to increase the level of perfection.

397
00:17:14,688 --> 00:17:16,646
Repeat this process a few times,

398
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,099
and in the process,

399
00:17:18,123 --> 00:17:19,487
you'll get rid of unnecessary processes

400
00:17:19,511 --> 00:17:21,164
later on.

401
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:24,097
When removing it,

402
00:17:24,121 --> 00:17:25,551
you'll be a bit faster,

403
00:17:25,575 --> 00:17:27,720
and you'll be able to raise your quality quickly.

404
00:17:27,978 --> 00:17:29,978
In the end, this means

405
00:17:30,002 --> 00:17:32,288
you can imagine

406
00:17:32,382 --> 00:17:35,431
what your illustration will look like

407
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:37,925
when it's finished.

408
00:17:38,914 --> 00:17:41,131
The more you can predict it,

409
00:17:41,155 --> 00:17:43,517
without unnecessary touches,

410
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,217
you can use touches that are optimized for your work,

411
00:17:45,242 --> 00:17:46,990
and you can finish the illustration.

412
00:17:48,221 --> 00:17:49,142
It also simply means

413
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,930
you can draw with a drawing tablet.

414
00:17:56,814 --> 00:17:59,658
The top part is bright and the bottom part is dark.

415
00:17:59,682 --> 00:18:00,548
It's going to go in like that.

416
00:18:00,572 --> 00:18:02,062
The light itself is

417
00:18:02,087 --> 00:18:04,701
based on what comes out from the face.

418
00:18:04,725 --> 00:18:07,074
As for the belt and skirt,

419
00:18:07,098 --> 00:18:09,801
you have to think of it as the light coming from above.

420
00:18:09,826 --> 00:18:13,488
Light doesn't always hit an object in dimensions,

421
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,440
but in most cases, the source of light

422
00:18:15,488 --> 00:18:17,740
exists as a dot.

423
00:18:18,185 --> 00:18:20,115
So based on that,

424
00:18:20,139 --> 00:18:22,327
you have to think that the light is spreading.

425
00:18:23,174 --> 00:18:25,476
The face closest to the light

426
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,036
is going to be the brightest part of the illustration.

427
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,565
This skirt gets a little further away from there

428
00:18:30,589 --> 00:18:32,513
or the tentacles in the back

429
00:18:32,537 --> 00:18:33,847
these sections

430
00:18:33,871 --> 00:18:36,509
need to be relatively darker.

431
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:38,913
Of course, that doesn't mean

432
00:18:38,937 --> 00:18:41,053
there should be a huge difference in tone.

433
00:18:41,077 --> 00:18:44,178
When it is a Soft Light,

434
00:18:44,202 --> 00:18:46,491
in other words, if it is light that spreads smoothly,

435
00:18:46,521 --> 00:18:48,601
I'm sure those things will be evident.

436
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:49,941
But, like the current illustration,

437
00:18:49,965 --> 00:18:52,201
if it's an illustration with strong light,

438
00:18:52,225 --> 00:18:53,937
the difference in the amount of light received from top to bottom

439
00:18:53,961 --> 00:18:55,471
doesn't come out that much.

440
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:58,155
But there's a difference in the angle.

441
00:18:58,157 --> 00:18:59,136
You have to realize it.

442
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,476
In other words, the face is exposed to the frontal light,

443
00:19:02,501 --> 00:19:05,548
but the chest is getting some light from above.

444
00:19:05,661 --> 00:19:08,286
The skirt receives light from the top.

445
00:19:08,311 --> 00:19:10,217
If you go down like this,

446
00:19:10,241 --> 00:19:12,615
the angle of light changes depending on the area.

447
00:19:13,316 --> 00:19:14,755
What's similar to this?

448
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:18,143
When it comes to the part where the angle keeps changing,

449
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:20,435
it's similar to perspective.

450
00:19:20,724 --> 00:19:23,288
If you recognize light through dots,

451
00:19:23,312 --> 00:19:26,287
it's easier to adapt to that kind of change.

452
00:19:26,312 --> 00:19:27,958
When you think of light,

453
00:19:27,982 --> 00:19:30,889
it will help if you

454
00:19:30,913 --> 00:19:32,913
think of the light source as a dot,

455
00:19:32,937 --> 00:19:36,526
rather than thinking of it in dimensions.

456
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,032
Of course, there are some exceptions.

457
00:19:42,972 --> 00:19:44,143
When you go into the tertiary colors,

458
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:46,090
are there any tips for putting them in nicely?

459
00:19:46,114 --> 00:19:48,001
There were some students who asked me this question.

460
00:19:48,031 --> 00:19:51,036
But as I said before, the tertiary colors

461
00:19:51,061 --> 00:19:53,488
go in so that it looks more three-dimensional.

462
00:19:53,512 --> 00:19:56,061
If the tone is not weird

463
00:19:56,086 --> 00:19:57,088
when you look at it in black and white,

464
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,836
if it goes in naturally,

465
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,342
applying tertiary colors is a very free thing.

466
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,496
You have a lot of freedom,

467
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,804
but, there's a relationship between the colors.

468
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:07,148
Similar and complementary colors.

469
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,053
We previously went over

470
00:20:09,077 --> 00:20:10,339
complementary colors a bit.

471
00:20:10,363 --> 00:20:12,615
Similar colors are literally colors that are similar.

472
00:20:12,639 --> 00:20:13,680
If there's yellow,

473
00:20:13,704 --> 00:20:16,801
the orange or red ones that are nearby on the color wheel are similar colors.

474
00:20:16,974 --> 00:20:19,828
I think it's good to use them well.

475
00:20:19,853 --> 00:20:22,209
In the end, it makes the color palette more attractive.

476
00:20:22,234 --> 00:20:24,775
It's a way to make the tertiary colors more attractive.

477
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,342
If you want to study more about that area,

478
00:20:27,366 --> 00:20:29,156
you can Google it.

479
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,892
If you search for color palettes

480
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,558
on Google,

481
00:20:32,582 --> 00:20:34,860
you should be able to find some

482
00:20:34,884 --> 00:20:36,206
readily made color palettes.

483
00:20:36,564 --> 00:20:37,979
When you take a look at them,

484
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:40,202
you can understand

485
00:20:40,226 --> 00:20:41,512
colors more easily.

486
00:20:41,758 --> 00:20:42,913
It's very helpful.

487
00:20:42,937 --> 00:20:44,848
As for the color palette,

488
00:20:44,872 --> 00:20:46,164
there are people who are studying it

489
00:20:46,188 --> 00:20:47,486
as their theme of practice.

490
00:20:50,274 --> 00:20:52,053
This is the part where there's no light

491
00:20:52,077 --> 00:20:53,339
because it's inside.

492
00:20:53,363 --> 00:20:54,863
I will add shadows,

493
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:56,217
and I will add the creases,

494
00:20:56,241 --> 00:20:58,039
but I won't dig in too deep.

495
00:21:00,863 --> 00:21:03,393
There's already been a shadow.

496
00:21:03,417 --> 00:21:05,695
So unless the creases are in too deep,

497
00:21:05,719 --> 00:21:06,927
I don't really describe it.

498
00:21:07,094 --> 00:21:09,727
Don't forget to add Form Shadow on the outer part.

499
00:21:11,993 --> 00:21:13,327
Occlusion Shadow.

500
00:21:13,351 --> 00:21:15,184
When the distance between objects is close to 0,

501
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,479
it's the dark shadow that goes in.

502
00:21:18,136 --> 00:21:19,259
Don't forget that.

503
00:21:19,284 --> 00:21:21,128
And if you do so, the quality will go up.

504
00:21:29,263 --> 00:21:31,215
When you add the tertiary color,

505
00:21:31,239 --> 00:21:35,218
it's good to use similar and complementary colors.

506
00:21:35,242 --> 00:21:37,117
If you use complementary colors, it stands out a lot.

507
00:21:37,141 --> 00:21:38,319
If you use similar colors,

508
00:21:38,343 --> 00:21:39,526
It doesn't stand out a lot.

509
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,629
It becomes smooth.

510
00:21:40,761 --> 00:21:42,020
Take advantage of it.

511
00:21:42,044 --> 00:21:43,727
I hope this section stands out.

512
00:21:43,729 --> 00:21:46,342
For example, if you look at the mint color area,

513
00:21:46,527 --> 00:21:48,745
which is the point color that goes into the skirt,

514
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,260
you can see that

515
00:21:50,285 --> 00:21:51,936
I used a strong pink for the tertiary color.

516
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,033
It's still simple.

517
00:21:54,057 --> 00:21:55,554
I wanted to show off that side.

518
00:21:55,578 --> 00:21:56,960
I think it's a prettier part

519
00:21:56,984 --> 00:21:58,811
of the skirt design.

520
00:21:58,835 --> 00:22:01,185
I wanted to show the highlight of that section.

521
00:22:01,214 --> 00:22:02,321
On that side, basically,

522
00:22:02,345 --> 00:22:04,058
I used a warm color.

523
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:06,768
Since blue is used a lot in the illustration,

524
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,792
if you use a warm color like that,

525
00:22:08,816 --> 00:22:10,518
I'm sure you will notice that section.

526
00:22:10,943 --> 00:22:12,549
Using that,

527
00:22:12,573 --> 00:22:14,599
that's how I made that area draw people's attention.

528
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:17,838
There are a lot of theories applied when drawing.

529
00:22:17,862 --> 00:22:20,458
What about complementary colors? What about point colors?

530
00:22:20,482 --> 00:22:22,249
When it comes to coloring,

531
00:22:22,273 --> 00:22:24,617
there are things like proportion.

532
00:22:24,641 --> 00:22:25,994
In the end, it's all about that.

533
00:22:26,018 --> 00:22:28,096
Depending on the areas you want to show,

534
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,286
you'll control those things.

535
00:22:31,365 --> 00:22:33,006
So, it depends on how you approach it,

536
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:35,175
it's not really a theoretical approach.

537
00:22:35,199 --> 00:22:36,954
The fact that I did this

538
00:22:36,978 --> 00:22:38,529
just to make the drawing look pretty,

539
00:22:38,553 --> 00:22:40,410
in a way, it can be a good enough reason.

540
00:22:40,434 --> 00:22:43,373
But theory is the the basis of illustrations.

541
00:22:43,397 --> 00:22:45,494
That's why we're studying theory.

542
00:22:46,568 --> 00:22:48,186
If you put in Occlusion Shadow,

543
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,292
the illustration becomes clear.

544
00:22:49,351 --> 00:22:52,285
If the picture becomes clearer, the visibility goes up.

545
00:22:52,309 --> 00:22:55,290
If the visibility goes up, you can see the character well.

546
00:22:55,314 --> 00:22:58,036
From the perspective of the viewers, the character will be pretty.

547
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,322
It can be felt well.

548
00:22:59,543 --> 00:23:01,173
So if you put in Occlusion Shadow,

549
00:23:01,197 --> 00:23:03,102
I told you that the quality of the picture goes up.

550
00:23:03,228 --> 00:23:04,617
That's because, in the end,

551
00:23:04,641 --> 00:23:07,609
Occlusion Shadow makes the picture look clearer.

552
00:23:07,945 --> 00:23:10,049
I made it look better from the perspective of the viewers.

553
00:23:11,478 --> 00:23:13,811
It's not that the Occlusion Shadow itself is important,

554
00:23:13,835 --> 00:23:16,209
but what you gain from it is important.

555
00:23:21,189 --> 00:23:23,040
Students will draw pictures,

556
00:23:23,064 --> 00:23:25,296
and those who are self-taught,

557
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,886
you're going to keep searching for theories.

558
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,556
When you do this,

559
00:23:29,581 --> 00:23:31,762
generally speaking, the illustration will look pretty,

560
00:23:31,786 --> 00:23:33,475
or it will look cute,

561
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,019
or it will look calm.

562
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:39,184
Among the theories that I mentioned earlier,

563
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:41,143
there were parts related to the gaze.

564
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:43,421
The triangular silhouette looks like this.

565
00:23:43,883 --> 00:23:45,938
The diamond silhouette looks like this.

566
00:23:45,963 --> 00:23:47,719
We talked about things like that.

567
00:23:48,288 --> 00:23:49,649
Those things are actually

568
00:23:49,673 --> 00:23:51,818
things I learned on my own.

569
00:23:51,842 --> 00:23:54,583
But after I learned them myself,

570
00:23:54,607 --> 00:23:56,470
I began looking for books.

571
00:23:56,572 --> 00:23:59,305
I read books related to the gaze,

572
00:23:59,329 --> 00:24:00,849
and books related to silhouettes.

573
00:24:00,874 --> 00:24:03,116
When I looked at the content,

574
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,430
some things were the same as I thought.

575
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,822
So, I learned more about theories

576
00:24:07,847 --> 00:24:09,541
as I looked them up.

577
00:24:09,947 --> 00:24:12,101
But what I felt before,

578
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:13,928
it was the same in the end.

579
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:16,584
If you've been taking my class,

580
00:24:16,608 --> 00:24:18,026
from the perspective of students,

581
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:19,751
the theory that I'm talking about,

582
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,941
could be a bit different from what you thought.

583
00:24:20,965 --> 00:24:23,441
There must have been some things that were the same.

584
00:24:23,741 --> 00:24:26,769
For example, if it's round, it looks cute.

585
00:24:26,793 --> 00:24:28,962
If it's sharp, it looks aggressive.

586
00:24:28,986 --> 00:24:31,174
Even if I tell elementary school students this,

587
00:24:31,198 --> 00:24:33,109
most of them have similar responses.

588
00:24:33,475 --> 00:24:36,594
I'm sure we could have thought about it together.

589
00:24:36,618 --> 00:24:38,788
The fact that we can use that in drawings

590
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:40,465
means that we can learn it in this class.

591
00:24:41,041 --> 00:24:43,041
I keep emphasizing it.

592
00:24:43,113 --> 00:24:45,326
Please change your perception regarding illustrations.

593
00:24:48,432 --> 00:24:50,512
You have to draw with your head.

594
00:24:51,004 --> 00:24:53,198
What your hands do is just outputting.

595
00:24:53,222 --> 00:24:55,560
When it comes to planning and expressing the picture itself,

596
00:24:55,584 --> 00:24:57,207
the most important thing is your head.

597
00:25:00,678 --> 00:25:02,622
I say this to my students.

598
00:25:02,646 --> 00:25:04,084
After drawing all day,

599
00:25:04,108 --> 00:25:05,390
your head needs to hurt.

600
00:25:06,562 --> 00:25:08,562
After you draw,

601
00:25:08,586 --> 00:25:10,690
you need to think about

602
00:25:10,715 --> 00:25:12,082
whether your head or your wrist hurts.

603
00:25:16,061 --> 00:25:17,605
The back of the hat

604
00:25:17,629 --> 00:25:19,720
is a part that protrudes outside.

605
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:22,935
It's a bit far from the center.

606
00:25:22,959 --> 00:25:24,631
So, I'll make it darker.

607
00:25:27,311 --> 00:25:29,458
The parts that stick out in the middle

608
00:25:29,899 --> 00:25:32,410
are probably one of the parts that receive the most light.

609
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,206
Except for the shadow of the hair itself,

610
00:25:35,313 --> 00:25:37,148
I'm going to make it brighter.

611
00:25:38,393 --> 00:25:39,536
I'll add a Cast Shadow

612
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,104
that goes to the top of the hat.

613
00:25:41,535 --> 00:25:43,403
Since the light is coming from the face,

614
00:25:43,427 --> 00:25:45,764
from the hat's perspective, it will be shining from below.

615
00:25:46,062 --> 00:25:48,716
That's why Cast Shadow looks like that.

616
00:26:03,498 --> 00:26:05,610
I'll accentuate the creases around the hat.

617
00:26:07,814 --> 00:26:08,886
For the creases on clothes,

618
00:26:08,911 --> 00:26:11,816
you may feel that the theory has been reduced a lot.

619
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,696
For the creases on clothes,

620
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,527
I didn't explain it that much.

621
00:26:15,623 --> 00:26:17,964
Actually, that's all.

622
00:26:17,988 --> 00:26:20,294
There are not that many theories about creases.

623
00:26:20,318 --> 00:26:22,735
The theory is just for the three things that I mentioned before.

624
00:26:23,285 --> 00:26:25,442
The X and Y shapes of the creases themselves,

625
00:26:25,688 --> 00:26:27,819
the center of gravity,

626
00:26:27,848 --> 00:26:29,381
and the direction of force.

627
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:32,557
Other than that, it changes depending on the material.

628
00:26:32,581 --> 00:26:33,723
In fact,

629
00:26:33,747 --> 00:26:35,887
if you touch the clothes, you'll know it immediately.

630
00:26:35,911 --> 00:26:38,829
Stiff clothes, thin clothes,

631
00:26:38,854 --> 00:26:40,470
you can feel it when you touch it.

632
00:26:40,495 --> 00:26:42,289
Other than that,

633
00:26:42,314 --> 00:26:43,472
even the creases on my clothes

634
00:26:43,496 --> 00:26:45,631
are an area where deformers go in.

635
00:26:45,655 --> 00:26:47,384
As expected, this is also about recognition.

636
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,868
The creases on the clothes, too.

637
00:26:48,893 --> 00:26:51,145
It's important to apply deformers

638
00:26:51,285 --> 00:26:52,925
so that it fits your drawing style.

639
00:26:52,949 --> 00:26:55,313
If your drawing style is realistic,

640
00:26:55,337 --> 00:26:57,552
if you think it's a detailed drawing style,

641
00:26:57,577 --> 00:26:59,905
you should try to describe the creases.

642
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:01,579
The more you do it,

643
00:27:01,604 --> 00:27:03,482
the more your drawing style will look attractive.

644
00:27:03,571 --> 00:27:05,206
But for me, it's totally casual.

645
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,780
I'm a person who draws cute things.

646
00:27:06,804 --> 00:27:08,859
If people like me draw creases on their clothes,

647
00:27:08,883 --> 00:27:09,983
it looks kind of gross.

648
00:27:10,764 --> 00:27:12,561
We should exclude things like that.

649
00:27:16,087 --> 00:27:18,438
I'm going to add Form Shadow for the tentacles in the back.

650
00:27:19,281 --> 00:27:21,919
I'm using a Hard Brush to describe it.

651
00:27:22,154 --> 00:27:23,928
When you put in Form Shadow,

652
00:27:23,952 --> 00:27:24,966
I'll give you a tip.

653
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,628
When you put in Form Shadow,

654
00:27:26,653 --> 00:27:29,201
it's important not to spread it out too much.

655
00:27:29,225 --> 00:27:31,584
We usually say an illustration looks burnt.

656
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,512
When the drawing turns too dark,

657
00:27:33,536 --> 00:27:35,826
or when your skin turns white,

658
00:27:35,851 --> 00:27:37,522
the biggest mistakes that happen

659
00:27:37,546 --> 00:27:38,660
have to do with the Form Shadow.

660
00:27:38,778 --> 00:27:40,778
I'll tell you two important things.

661
00:27:40,802 --> 00:27:45,256
First, Form Shadow is always brighter than Cast Shadow.

662
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,679
I said this before.

663
00:27:46,703 --> 00:27:49,797
The shadow between the objects is a bit darker,

664
00:27:49,821 --> 00:27:52,511
so Form Shadow has a bright tone.

665
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,168
In other words, the dimension that is applied,

666
00:27:54,192 --> 00:27:56,378
it doesn't spin as much as you think.

667
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:57,924
As for Cast Shadow,

668
00:27:57,948 --> 00:27:59,464
the light is completely blocked.

669
00:27:59,488 --> 00:28:02,617
For Form Shadow, the angle goes around 15 degrees.

670
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:03,688
That's the Form Shadow.

671
00:28:03,713 --> 00:28:06,562
So it's important to go in little by little.

672
00:28:06,586 --> 00:28:07,723
In terms of color.

673
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,391
And the second important thing is

674
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,879
that the area of Form Shadow isn't as wide as you think.

675
00:28:13,193 --> 00:28:14,875
Form Shadow is

676
00:28:14,899 --> 00:28:17,354
the border between the section

677
00:28:17,378 --> 00:28:18,939
where light comes in and the section where light doesn't come in.

678
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:20,870
It goes in slightly and

679
00:28:20,894 --> 00:28:23,063
continuously, throughout the illustration.

680
00:28:23,388 --> 00:28:25,976
0, 10, 20, 30, 40

681
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,738
The light doesn't come in order like this.

682
00:28:28,762 --> 00:28:31,383
If the area where the light comes in is 100,

683
00:28:31,408 --> 00:28:33,408
and if the place where there's no light is zero,

684
00:28:33,432 --> 00:28:35,686
in the meantime, in the 50th part,

685
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,511
the Form Shadow goes in there.

686
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:39,213
That is, Form Shadow

687
00:28:39,237 --> 00:28:41,237
is not widely spread out.

688
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:43,141
You put them all in at once

689
00:28:43,165 --> 00:28:44,441
on the edges where things go around.

690
00:28:44,604 --> 00:28:46,657
Especially round objects such as

691
00:28:46,681 --> 00:28:48,191
the shoulders and the chest.

692
00:28:48,215 --> 00:28:50,270
If there are parts like that in the outfits,

693
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:52,628
even in the case of things like that,

694
00:28:52,652 --> 00:28:56,121
it's important to add light and shade to the edges.

695
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,543
In this process,

696
00:28:58,567 --> 00:29:00,608
by applying the form shadow widely,

697
00:29:00,632 --> 00:29:02,103
it looks like it's burning.

698
00:29:02,127 --> 00:29:04,224
It does look 3D,

699
00:29:04,248 --> 00:29:06,166
but things look very artificial,

700
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:08,130
and that's the kind of problem that often happens.

701
00:29:08,154 --> 00:29:09,185
It happens quite often.

702
00:29:09,209 --> 00:29:11,528
So what's important when you apply Form sSadow is,

703
00:29:11,553 --> 00:29:13,794
not to make it too wide.

704
00:29:14,704 --> 00:29:16,377
These decorations,

705
00:29:16,954 --> 00:29:19,469
there's going to be some distance from the fabric.

706
00:29:19,493 --> 00:29:22,042
You'll see some parts where the casting of the shadow is emphasizing it.

707
00:29:22,545 --> 00:29:24,720
It strengthens the form shadow on the hat,

708
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:26,238
so the upper part of the character is quite

709
00:29:26,262 --> 00:29:27,963
three-dimensional.

710
00:29:28,544 --> 00:29:30,184
By checking it in black and white,

711
00:29:35,793 --> 00:29:38,325
let's think about the casting shadow

712
00:29:38,349 --> 00:29:39,391
that you might have been missing.

713
00:29:39,415 --> 00:29:41,830
People often miss the casting shadow.

714
00:29:41,987 --> 00:29:43,309
I couldn't help it.

715
00:29:43,466 --> 00:29:45,103
Therefore,

716
00:29:45,127 --> 00:29:47,377
we have to make sure not to miss it.

717
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,318
Finding the casting shadow that we lost,

718
00:29:51,342 --> 00:29:52,523
let's put 1 or 2 each.

719
00:30:12,592 --> 00:30:14,110
If you added casting shadow,

720
00:30:14,134 --> 00:30:16,382
take care of the boundary colors around it.

721
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:29,303
If you look over here,

722
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,731
the casting shadow changes depending on the teeth shape.

723
00:30:32,111 --> 00:30:34,509
To be exact, depending on the shape of the teeth in the body stockings,

724
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:36,725
you'll be able to see the shape change little by little.

725
00:30:36,749 --> 00:30:39,398
Let's find out what's important about Cast Shadow.

726
00:30:39,422 --> 00:30:41,971
The Form Shadow mustn't spread widely.

727
00:30:41,995 --> 00:30:43,070
That's what I said.

728
00:30:43,094 --> 00:30:45,520
What's important about Cast Shadow is

729
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:48,181
you have to understand that

730
00:30:48,205 --> 00:30:49,582
it is something that is added on.

731
00:30:49,644 --> 00:30:50,910
What I'm saying is,

732
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:53,734
Cast Shadow changes the shape

733
00:30:53,758 --> 00:30:55,665
depending on the object at the bottom,

734
00:30:55,689 --> 00:30:56,976
or the one on the top.

735
00:30:57,084 --> 00:30:58,817
And depending on the angle of light,

736
00:30:58,841 --> 00:31:00,841
it's close to the concept of changing positions.

737
00:31:00,882 --> 00:31:03,567
So if the object on the top is a circle,

738
00:31:03,591 --> 00:31:05,648
of course, the shadow will be round.

739
00:31:05,722 --> 00:31:08,031
But when the object on the top is square,

740
00:31:08,055 --> 00:31:10,224
and the object underneath is a circle,

741
00:31:10,248 --> 00:31:11,888
what would the shadow look like then?

742
00:31:12,163 --> 00:31:14,984
The shadow keeps a square shape.

743
00:31:15,231 --> 00:31:16,965
But,

744
00:31:16,989 --> 00:31:19,784
it's more like it's put on the ball

745
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:21,808
at the bottom of the circle.

746
00:31:21,833 --> 00:31:23,579
So, on top of the object below,

747
00:31:23,603 --> 00:31:24,839
you can apply the casting shadow

748
00:31:24,863 --> 00:31:26,708
on the top.

749
00:31:26,732 --> 00:31:28,667
The shadow on the tentacles is spinning.

750
00:31:28,691 --> 00:31:30,218
And the reason why it goes outwards is,

751
00:31:30,242 --> 00:31:32,611
because the tentacles on the bottom are round as well,

752
00:31:32,635 --> 00:31:34,392
that's how it's formed.

753
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:37,964
This is one of the most difficult parts.

754
00:31:38,077 --> 00:31:40,391
Also, measuring the distance between objects and putting them in

755
00:31:40,415 --> 00:31:42,415
is also important in Cast Shadow.

756
00:31:42,439 --> 00:31:44,727
Especially if I have to point out the difficult part,

757
00:31:44,751 --> 00:31:46,306
I want to mention that one.

758
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:48,243
So, depending on the shape of things below,

759
00:31:48,267 --> 00:31:50,966
the shape of the Cast Shadow changes drastically.

760
00:31:51,497 --> 00:31:53,047
So it's important to go in,

761
00:31:53,072 --> 00:31:54,705
using that section.

762
00:31:55,186 --> 00:31:57,665
Let's check the important parts

763
00:31:57,689 --> 00:31:59,518
of the Form Shadow and Cast Shadow.

764
00:32:04,295 --> 00:32:07,397
What I just said is not just an important point,

765
00:32:07,421 --> 00:32:08,418
but also what you have to care about.

766
00:32:08,442 --> 00:32:10,249
A lot of errors can come up.

767
00:32:10,434 --> 00:32:12,074
Like a case where the illustration burns

768
00:32:12,098 --> 00:32:13,915
due to too much Form Shadow.

769
00:32:14,067 --> 00:32:15,511
Or with Cast Shadow,

770
00:32:15,535 --> 00:32:17,710
if you don't care about the shape of things,

771
00:32:17,734 --> 00:32:20,065
the shape itself may look unnatural.

772
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,135
Especially, out of habit,

773
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,159
there are people who apply the shadows like that.

774
00:32:24,712 --> 00:32:26,712
Especially for those who draw the human body,

775
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:28,736
when they put light and shadow on the bottom of the chest,

776
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,760
or when they put shadow on the neck,

777
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:33,324
there are some shapes that they use a lot.

778
00:32:33,348 --> 00:32:35,589
There are people who draw it unconsciously.

779
00:32:36,532 --> 00:32:40,180
Of course, if it's a casual and flat drawing,

780
00:32:40,216 --> 00:32:41,792
it's not that you can't use it.

781
00:32:41,816 --> 00:32:44,613
But that itself is already applied incorrectly.

782
00:32:44,637 --> 00:32:47,492
So, the illustration will come out unnaturally.

783
00:32:47,516 --> 00:32:49,691
So in order to use it more naturally,

784
00:32:49,715 --> 00:32:51,516
you need to recognize it

785
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,994
as an object.

786
00:32:53,509 --> 00:32:56,493
Recognize it as

787
00:32:56,518 --> 00:32:57,510
a three-dimensional object.

788
00:32:57,534 --> 00:32:59,340
Look at what's underneath

789
00:32:59,365 --> 00:33:00,462
and look at the object above.

790
00:33:00,486 --> 00:33:03,090
You need to add shadow as something that goes on top of the object.

791
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:23,744
Keep going down.

792
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:25,768
Think of the shape of the round tentacles.

793
00:33:25,792 --> 00:33:27,399
You can see that there are shadows.

794
00:33:35,882 --> 00:33:37,461
Even the things inside...

795
00:33:37,485 --> 00:33:39,051
I'm going to add a little bit of highlight.

796
00:33:50,244 --> 00:33:52,899
I put in the description for the rest of the areas.

797
00:33:52,923 --> 00:33:55,022
Since there's a shadow in that area,

798
00:33:55,046 --> 00:33:57,087
It's important not to make it too dark.

799
00:34:24,135 --> 00:34:25,887
As for the bottom of the chest,

800
00:34:25,912 --> 00:34:27,968
overall, it looks like it's sticking out.

801
00:34:27,992 --> 00:34:30,055
So, you can reduce it to Form Shadow.

802
00:34:32,881 --> 00:34:34,531
From time to time,

803
00:34:34,555 --> 00:34:36,555
there are one or two sections

804
00:34:36,579 --> 00:34:37,857
that you can't help but paint awkwardly.

805
00:34:37,881 --> 00:34:38,945
Because we're human after all.

806
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:40,664
It's important to fix it

807
00:34:40,694 --> 00:34:42,488
as you continue to do those parts.

808
00:34:42,595 --> 00:34:44,821
In the end, the ability to complete an illustration

809
00:34:44,845 --> 00:34:47,181
is the ability to give feedback on your own illustrations.

810
00:34:47,206 --> 00:34:49,029
It depends on how good it is.

811
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:51,945
It's called self-feedback, and I've emphasized it before.

812
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:53,917
The better your self-feedback skills are,

813
00:34:53,941 --> 00:34:55,887
the more the overall completeness of the illustration

814
00:34:55,911 --> 00:34:57,561
can be improved.

815
00:34:57,585 --> 00:34:59,045
Because of that,

816
00:34:59,069 --> 00:35:01,657
for those who draw really well,

817
00:35:01,681 --> 00:35:03,735
even though it's their first time,

818
00:35:03,759 --> 00:35:05,876
there are many people who have that ability.

819
00:35:05,922 --> 00:35:08,387
They can objectively look at their illustrations,

820
00:35:08,411 --> 00:35:10,798
and by analyzing the data of the objectified parts

821
00:35:10,822 --> 00:35:12,924
they can apply it and fix it.

822
00:35:13,021 --> 00:35:15,334
And if you are comfortable with it,

823
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:17,712
I'm sure we can call it talent.

824
00:35:18,376 --> 00:35:20,757
I think it's a talent.

825
00:35:20,781 --> 00:35:23,220
Actually, that itself,

826
00:35:23,244 --> 00:35:25,574
I don't think it's something you can't have.

827
00:35:25,598 --> 00:35:27,455
But of course, there are differences depending on the individual.

828
00:35:27,479 --> 00:35:28,892
When we first started,

829
00:35:28,916 --> 00:35:31,637
how well you analyzed the data

830
00:35:31,661 --> 00:35:34,179
and how much you could make it your own,

831
00:35:34,203 --> 00:35:36,126
everyone has their own differences.

832
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:39,028
That's true, but if you know you have to do it,

833
00:35:39,052 --> 00:35:41,132
I think anyone can do it.

834
00:35:41,156 --> 00:35:43,986
Even though the efficiency is different, anyone can do it.

835
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:45,440
But if someone doesn't tell you to do it,

836
00:35:45,442 --> 00:35:47,204
you won't really do those parts.

837
00:35:47,489 --> 00:35:48,908
When it comes to drawing,

838
00:35:48,933 --> 00:35:50,736
I think your skills will improve as you draw.

839
00:35:50,761 --> 00:35:53,403
But then you might end up drawing stupidly.

840
00:35:53,427 --> 00:35:55,543
There might be people who feel guilty about this.

841
00:35:55,567 --> 00:35:57,179
To be honest,

842
00:35:57,204 --> 00:35:59,043
while drawing your own illustrations,

843
00:35:59,067 --> 00:36:02,028
there are people who think that

844
00:36:02,052 --> 00:36:03,626
their skills will improve by drawing what they want to draw.

845
00:36:04,442 --> 00:36:05,850
Of course, it's not that nothing improved.

846
00:36:05,874 --> 00:36:06,753
Your skills will improve.

847
00:36:06,777 --> 00:36:09,376
You will improve, but you won't necessarily improve quickly.

848
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:18,152
In the end, illustration is about

849
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:22,162
observation, analysis, and application.

850
00:36:22,186 --> 00:36:23,324
It goes in stages.

851
00:36:25,212 --> 00:36:27,212
In the end, this part is recognition.

852
00:36:29,491 --> 00:36:31,074
What is an illustration?

853
00:36:31,098 --> 00:36:32,569
Let's take a look at it again.

854
00:36:38,992 --> 00:36:40,902
I'm going to strengthen the Occlusion Shadow.

855
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,450
And the Cast Shadow to the hair.

856
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:52,080
I'll put it in a little bit

857
00:36:52,104 --> 00:36:53,153
to the areas that are distant.

858
00:36:55,878 --> 00:36:57,557
I'm still trying to describe it.

859
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:59,133
It's about grit.

860
00:37:17,613 --> 00:37:20,199
In today's description stage, the theoretical content

861
00:37:20,223 --> 00:37:21,528
plays a key role...

862
00:37:21,552 --> 00:37:23,349
I'm almost done expressing 70%.

863
00:37:23,373 --> 00:37:26,119
The remaining 30% will be edited later.

864
00:37:26,287 --> 00:37:28,958
The theories that I'm describing and using now,

865
00:37:28,983 --> 00:37:30,714
they're a repetition of what I did in the beginning.

866
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:33,170
I'm repeating myself.

867
00:37:35,249 --> 00:37:37,249
The shadow area is basically

868
00:37:37,273 --> 00:37:39,905
the parts where there's no light,

869
00:37:39,929 --> 00:37:41,456
so you'll raise the saturation

870
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,722
when you work on it.

871
00:37:44,081 --> 00:37:46,817
In the process of adding light and shadow, I'll increase the saturation.

872
00:37:46,852 --> 00:37:49,214
I have to lower the brightness a little.

873
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:50,747
The reason why I do that is,

874
00:37:50,771 --> 00:37:54,299
the tone of the shadow needs to go down,

875
00:37:54,324 --> 00:37:56,192
but this tone

876
00:37:56,216 --> 00:38:00,372
goes down as the brightness goes down and as the saturation goes up.

877
00:38:00,787 --> 00:38:03,561
In order to lower the tone of that area,

878
00:38:03,585 --> 00:38:06,744
I'll adjust the brightness and saturation together.

879
00:38:06,768 --> 00:38:10,154
When you make the saturation strong and the brightness low,

880
00:38:10,179 --> 00:38:12,628
the tone of that area gets lower.

881
00:38:12,652 --> 00:38:16,105
If you want to lower the tone,

882
00:38:16,129 --> 00:38:18,814
to do that, turn the color.

883
00:38:18,844 --> 00:38:20,667
Use a color that has a lower natural brightness.

884
00:38:20,691 --> 00:38:21,790
If you do that,

885
00:38:21,814 --> 00:38:24,543
you'll feel like your tone is going to go down a little bit.

886
00:38:24,812 --> 00:38:25,850
So when you give shadow,

887
00:38:25,852 --> 00:38:27,384
that's how it goes in.

888
00:38:27,811 --> 00:38:29,357
There are three things you need to do.

889
00:38:29,381 --> 00:38:31,406
Changing the color to a darker area,

890
00:38:31,514 --> 00:38:33,759
lowering the brightness, and raising the saturation.

891
00:38:33,784 --> 00:38:36,706
If you do this, you'll get the right color for the shadow.

892
00:38:36,807 --> 00:38:38,629
Of course, it depends on

893
00:38:38,653 --> 00:38:41,003
what the lighting conditions are.

894
00:38:45,785 --> 00:38:48,697
Depending on the lighting conditions and the coloring method,

895
00:38:48,721 --> 00:38:49,903
there are times when it changes.

896
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:52,343
Those are the basics.

897
00:39:01,482 --> 00:39:03,576
Even with the creature with tentacles at the bottom,

898
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,600
I'm going to make it darker.

899
00:39:05,624 --> 00:39:07,624
And I'm going to add some Form Shadow.

900
00:39:08,411 --> 00:39:10,841
I'm trying to give a strong Form Shadow to this.

901
00:39:10,871 --> 00:39:13,718
Compared to other things, it's a round object.

902
00:39:14,691 --> 00:39:17,079
And those kinds of creatures

903
00:39:17,103 --> 00:39:18,419
need to be three-dimensional

904
00:39:18,443 --> 00:39:20,625
so that it's kind of gross when you look at it.

905
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,188
Let's draw the tentacles, too.

906
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:27,534
In the current drawing, there are a lot of tentacles like that.

907
00:39:27,558 --> 00:39:29,279
Because of the composition, there are a lot of them.

908
00:39:29,303 --> 00:39:31,303
If you describe them in too much detail,

909
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:32,662
it'll make the drawing a little gross.

910
00:39:32,776 --> 00:39:34,783
So, I'm going to pay attention to it.

911
00:39:42,534 --> 00:39:44,741
There will be a little light applied

912
00:39:44,765 --> 00:39:46,598
to the deep hollows at the top.

913
00:39:46,622 --> 00:39:48,056
I'm going to use the Occlusion Shadow

914
00:39:48,081 --> 00:39:49,279
to dig deep.

915
00:39:57,095 --> 00:39:59,946
Let's make it look like there's cracks.

916
00:40:21,049 --> 00:40:23,695
Now, I need to work on the lower leg, too

917
00:40:26,865 --> 00:40:28,601
What I'm doing right now,

918
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:30,540
it's like the 3rd description.

919
00:40:30,565 --> 00:40:31,988
Normally, until it's done,

920
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:34,812
4th and 5th descriptions will be necessary.

921
00:40:36,981 --> 00:40:40,185
In terms of percentage, I think up to 70%, when I work,

922
00:40:40,209 --> 00:40:41,579
that's what I'm trying to achieve.

923
00:40:41,603 --> 00:40:43,695
By the time the video ends,

924
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:45,719
it will be 60-70% done.

925
00:40:45,744 --> 00:40:46,651
And,

926
00:40:46,675 --> 00:40:48,917
the 30 percent that follows is the same.

927
00:40:48,941 --> 00:40:52,018
Describe and balance.

928
00:40:52,042 --> 00:40:53,586
It's a repetition of that.

929
00:40:57,858 --> 00:40:59,818
The shadows that might be created by the legs,

930
00:40:59,843 --> 00:41:01,116
I expressed them darkly.

931
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:07,687
At the boundary of the Cast Shadow,

932
00:41:07,711 --> 00:41:09,490
you'll be able to see it.

933
00:41:09,514 --> 00:41:10,547
Even the way you keep adding tertiary colors.

934
00:41:10,781 --> 00:41:13,252
When you add a tertiary color, please observe it carefully.

935
00:41:13,276 --> 00:41:16,166
When you add a tertiary color, you might accidentally paint that part too dark.

936
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,494
I do that a lot.

937
00:41:18,034 --> 00:41:19,189
As I said before,

938
00:41:19,214 --> 00:41:21,527
As the saturation goes up, the tone goes down.

939
00:41:21,551 --> 00:41:23,498
This is when you couldn't calculate it.

940
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:26,130
So you have to check it out by looking at the black and white version

941
00:41:26,154 --> 00:41:27,753
to see if the tone is working.

942
00:41:27,951 --> 00:41:29,742
When you get used to it,

943
00:41:29,767 --> 00:41:31,310
the color you'll use to color it in,

944
00:41:31,334 --> 00:41:33,630
if you look at it in black and white, you'll see that it looks like this.

945
00:41:33,654 --> 00:41:35,006
You can start predicting.

946
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:36,809
In other words,

947
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:39,657
you can't guess until you do it.

948
00:41:39,682 --> 00:41:41,725
When it becomes brighter than you think,

949
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,522
it's the opposite.

950
00:41:43,582 --> 00:41:45,523
So when you add the tertiary color,

951
00:41:45,547 --> 00:41:47,663
keep observing it in black and white.

952
00:41:47,687 --> 00:41:49,556
Even if it's not the time to add a tertiary color,

953
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,164
keep looking at it in black and white.

954
00:41:56,731 --> 00:41:58,937
It's okay to look at it all the time.

955
00:41:59,086 --> 00:42:04,014
Or, you can make a small new screen.

956
00:42:04,038 --> 00:42:07,176
With the Arrange Tool, I'll make a new one.

957
00:42:07,201 --> 00:42:09,779
It's okay to change it into black and white.

958
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,608
And then let's look at it more often.

959
00:42:33,852 --> 00:42:36,925
The creature near the character's legs

960
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:39,084
is the part where the gaze would be focused.

961
00:42:39,108 --> 00:42:41,921
It'd be nice if you pay attention to the details in that area.

962
00:42:43,038 --> 00:42:44,156
In the end, the details

963
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,947
should go into the areas where the gaze goes.

964
00:42:53,687 --> 00:42:55,776
Wouldn't it be simpler if you think like this?

965
00:42:56,094 --> 00:42:57,537
The part I want to put in...

966
00:42:57,561 --> 00:43:00,157
In other words, add details to the part you intend to emphasize.

967
00:43:00,938 --> 00:43:03,571
The areas that aren't important in this illustration,

968
00:43:03,595 --> 00:43:06,113
take out the details for the areas that are less important.

969
00:43:06,137 --> 00:43:08,294
If you just hear it, they're simple.

970
00:43:09,861 --> 00:43:12,159
I'm going to edit it now.

971
00:43:12,279 --> 00:43:14,650
I will edit it as a whole.

972
00:43:14,674 --> 00:43:15,921
Using the Overlay function,

973
00:43:15,946 --> 00:43:18,240
I'll brighten up the part that receives light.

974
00:43:21,689 --> 00:43:24,028
Use the basic Hard Brush to work on it,

975
00:43:24,052 --> 00:43:26,900
and if you apply Overlay with an Air Brush,

976
00:43:27,012 --> 00:43:29,352
It will feel like the light is spreading out.

977
00:43:29,376 --> 00:43:31,462
There are times when the drawing is applied smoothly.

978
00:43:33,305 --> 00:43:35,464
Then the quality of the drawing will look much higher.

979
00:43:36,792 --> 00:43:38,445
I'm going to add an Overlay like this.

980
00:43:38,469 --> 00:43:39,905
It feels like I'm balancing again.

981
00:43:40,235 --> 00:43:41,498
When you look at it as a whole,

982
00:43:41,522 --> 00:43:43,522
the middle part needs to be the brightest,

983
00:43:43,546 --> 00:43:45,073
and the edges should be dark.

984
00:43:45,097 --> 00:43:47,246
During the coloring process, that area got a bit weak.

985
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:48,601
So I made it brighter

986
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:50,224
by adding the Overlay function in the middle.

987
00:43:51,684 --> 00:43:54,370
As I said before, I worked on balancing things,

988
00:43:54,399 --> 00:43:55,386
and I did it quickly.

989
00:43:58,834 --> 00:44:01,075
If it's balanced, describe it again.

990
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,382
Let's get into it.

991
00:44:46,005 --> 00:44:47,252
The tentacles in the back will also be described

992
00:44:47,277 --> 00:44:49,920
down below.

993
00:44:51,918 --> 00:44:53,597
The more the tentacles fall back,

994
00:44:53,622 --> 00:44:55,411
the darker it will get.

995
00:44:55,435 --> 00:44:57,654
Think about it in your head.

996
00:45:04,858 --> 00:45:08,044
Cast Shadow, tertiary color.

997
00:45:12,258 --> 00:45:13,708
The shadow that I'm giving right now,

998
00:45:13,732 --> 00:45:15,578
is it Cast Shadow or Form Shadow?

999
00:45:15,602 --> 00:45:16,867
Please keep thinking about it.

1000
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:21,214
If you drew an illustration while taking this lecture,

1001
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:22,855
If you drew it yourself,

1002
00:45:22,879 --> 00:45:24,992
when you apply shadow to what you drew...

1003
00:45:25,016 --> 00:45:27,252
What I'm applying now is Cast Shadow.

1004
00:45:27,276 --> 00:45:29,523
What I'm applying now is Form Shadow.

1005
00:45:29,547 --> 00:45:31,158
Divide it up and work on it.

1006
00:45:31,315 --> 00:45:33,067
Among the Form Shadows,

1007
00:45:33,092 --> 00:45:35,371
it's a Form Shadow that's weaker than a thick Form Shadow.

1008
00:45:35,396 --> 00:45:37,313
It's okay to think about it to some extent.

1009
00:45:37,398 --> 00:45:39,612
But I just divided those two things.

1010
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:41,002
Cast Shadow, Form Shadow.

1011
00:45:41,026 --> 00:45:42,436
Please divide those two.

1012
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,722
Those two are usually...

1013
00:45:46,746 --> 00:45:48,608
Before we can establish a theory,

1014
00:45:48,632 --> 00:45:50,182
it's mostly mixed.

1015
00:45:50,362 --> 00:45:53,720
That's why some people's drawings become darker.

1016
00:45:53,788 --> 00:45:55,578
Once we're done with the description,

1017
00:45:55,602 --> 00:45:58,189
one of the characteristics of people who have dark illustrations is

1018
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:00,377
that the color they used for the Cast Shadow,

1019
00:46:00,401 --> 00:46:01,694
they use it for the Form Shadow.

1020
00:46:01,718 --> 00:46:03,658
Even if it's annoying, please use the Eyedropper tool.

1021
00:46:03,682 --> 00:46:05,455
Don't use the same color.

1022
00:46:06,019 --> 00:46:07,537
Form Shadow and Cast Shadow

1023
00:46:07,561 --> 00:46:09,294
have very different properties.

1024
00:46:10,111 --> 00:46:13,122
So if possible, you need to use a new color.

1025
00:46:28,845 --> 00:46:29,994
Now, the bottom.

1026
00:46:30,018 --> 00:46:32,349
Now I'm going to draw the facial parts of the creature.

1027
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:33,827
The border between the tentacles

1028
00:46:33,851 --> 00:46:35,858
is where the viewers need to point their gaze.

1029
00:46:35,882 --> 00:46:37,471
Compared to other parts,

1030
00:46:37,495 --> 00:46:39,402
you'll be able to see how deep it is.

1031
00:46:45,184 --> 00:46:47,047
But why do we have to make people look over there?

1032
00:46:47,071 --> 00:46:47,834
It's simple.

1033
00:46:47,858 --> 00:46:50,027
The tentacles are in the same color

1034
00:46:50,051 --> 00:46:52,493
as that creature over there.

1035
00:46:52,517 --> 00:46:54,854
The creature and the character on top of it

1036
00:46:54,878 --> 00:46:56,812
are the same color.

1037
00:46:56,836 --> 00:46:58,280
Between the character and the creature,

1038
00:46:58,304 --> 00:46:59,965
between the creature and the tentacles,

1039
00:46:59,989 --> 00:47:02,694
you have to make it darker in between

1040
00:47:02,718 --> 00:47:04,170
so that you can see it clearly.

1041
00:47:04,195 --> 00:47:05,970
So, the border area

1042
00:47:05,994 --> 00:47:07,650
kind of acts as a line.

1043
00:47:07,674 --> 00:47:08,821
It's a Form Shadow.

1044
00:47:11,126 --> 00:47:13,425
This area and that area are different.

1045
00:47:13,449 --> 00:47:15,200
That's what you need to show people.

1046
00:47:15,441 --> 00:47:17,214
So, that makes our illustrations

1047
00:47:17,238 --> 00:47:19,067
more vivid.

1048
00:47:19,173 --> 00:47:21,109
You get more visibility

1049
00:47:21,133 --> 00:47:23,358
by making the character stand out.

1050
00:47:24,458 --> 00:47:26,411
For all the objects that fell into the bottom,

1051
00:47:26,541 --> 00:47:27,979
let's add Cast Shadow.

1052
00:47:28,096 --> 00:47:30,194
The description is sad, but it's manual labor.

1053
00:47:30,552 --> 00:47:32,889
Illustration can't be done

1054
00:47:34,403 --> 00:47:35,495
without it.

1055
00:47:38,002 --> 00:47:40,166
Whatever you do, it's manual labor.

1056
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:42,354
Even if you draw it like cel animation, you end up having to do labor.

1057
00:47:47,589 --> 00:47:49,273
It's the path you've chosen,

1058
00:47:51,394 --> 00:47:53,224
so you have to endure it.

1059
00:48:17,222 --> 00:48:18,458
For the tentacles that fell back,

1060
00:48:18,482 --> 00:48:20,383
I'm going to use Cast Shadow again.

1061
00:48:20,613 --> 00:48:23,235
It's relatively out of the outer part,

1062
00:48:23,297 --> 00:48:25,049
so the distance between the tentacles will get closer,

1063
00:48:25,073 --> 00:48:26,315
except for the middle part.

1064
00:48:26,339 --> 00:48:28,732
You'll be able to see that the Cast Shadow goes in quite deep.

1065
00:48:31,501 --> 00:48:32,839
The closer the distance is,

1066
00:48:32,863 --> 00:48:35,289
the more the amount of the Cast Shadow will decrease.

1067
00:48:35,313 --> 00:48:37,102
But it will get darker.

1068
00:48:37,204 --> 00:48:38,924
The closer the distance is,

1069
00:48:38,948 --> 00:48:40,194
the more it will get darker.

1070
00:48:40,244 --> 00:48:42,244
The Cast Shadow will become smaller.

1071
00:48:42,268 --> 00:48:43,804
But the farther away things are,

1072
00:48:43,828 --> 00:48:45,651
the wider the Cast Shadow spreads.

1073
00:48:45,675 --> 00:48:48,335
The border is scattered and the color is faded.

1074
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:50,037
That's what I said before.

1075
00:49:04,234 --> 00:49:06,765
The hair and the tentacles on the back,

1076
00:49:06,789 --> 00:49:08,043
because they are far apart,

1077
00:49:08,067 --> 00:49:09,834
I'm painting the rear area dark

1078
00:49:09,858 --> 00:49:11,793
so that people can see their differences.

1079
00:49:12,028 --> 00:49:14,042
The hair in the foreground will be bright.

1080
00:49:14,066 --> 00:49:16,313
The tentacles in the background will be dark.

1081
00:49:17,948 --> 00:49:20,481
So, I clearly showed the close-range view and the distant view.

1082
00:49:20,505 --> 00:49:22,725
The illustration will be more three-dimensional.

1083
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:25,018
You can say that there's depth to it.

1084
00:49:25,477 --> 00:49:27,699
The deeper you make the area,

1085
00:49:27,724 --> 00:49:29,415
from the viewer's point of view,

1086
00:49:30,387 --> 00:49:32,206
the illustration will look wider.

1087
00:49:33,814 --> 00:49:36,369
It's safe to say it looks more pleasant.

1088
00:49:52,082 --> 00:49:54,325
Put in the borderlines while checking with the black and white.

1089
00:49:58,549 --> 00:50:00,415
There's some progress.

1090
00:50:14,735 --> 00:50:16,047
Form Shadow.

1091
00:50:51,605 --> 00:50:54,478
Since it's the upper tentacle

1092
00:50:54,502 --> 00:50:56,081
that goes backwards,

1093
00:50:57,048 --> 00:50:58,983
let's make it darker.

1094
00:50:59,007 --> 00:51:00,920
I need to show that it fell back.

1095
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:03,788
But if you make it too dark,

1096
00:51:03,812 --> 00:51:05,724
it looks like you can see the eyes

1097
00:51:05,748 --> 00:51:08,448
at the back of the tentacles.

1098
00:51:08,912 --> 00:51:11,003
I'm not going to make it completely black.

1099
00:51:11,367 --> 00:51:12,711
And from the back,

1100
00:51:12,735 --> 00:51:14,335
we need to distinguish them

1101
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,931
with these sharp rocks.

1102
00:51:15,955 --> 00:51:18,481
I'm going to keep the color white.

1103
00:51:18,788 --> 00:51:20,066
I'm going to maintain it.

1104
00:51:20,091 --> 00:51:22,025
But the tone of that section is a bit higher

1105
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:24,497
to the point where it will be darkened.

1106
00:51:24,521 --> 00:51:26,812
Draw it so that it goes down.

1107
00:51:28,671 --> 00:51:29,921
Add Form Shadow.

1108
00:51:30,725 --> 00:51:32,725
Repeat it to the point that you're sick of it.

1109
00:51:40,314 --> 00:51:42,887
If you draw an illustration with this much information,

1110
00:51:42,911 --> 00:51:45,683
there's another thing you need to keep in mind from time to time.

1111
00:51:45,707 --> 00:51:48,328
You need to see if your illustration isn't too heavy.

1112
00:51:48,352 --> 00:51:50,415
Casual character illustration is actually,

1113
00:51:50,439 --> 00:51:52,574
in a way, when it comes to illustrations,

1114
00:51:52,598 --> 00:51:55,448
it's okay to say that it is like fast food.

1115
00:51:55,562 --> 00:51:58,624
So, it needs to be light.

1116
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:00,934
You need to be able to look at it comfortably from the perspective of the viewers.

1117
00:52:01,242 --> 00:52:03,405
Of course, the illustration that goes into games,

1118
00:52:03,429 --> 00:52:04,550
compared to most of them, it's a little

1119
00:52:04,574 --> 00:52:06,574
too detailed.

1120
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:07,725
It's a more detailed illustration,

1121
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:09,952
but still, compared to

1122
00:52:09,976 --> 00:52:12,485
a classic Renaissance painting,

1123
00:52:12,509 --> 00:52:14,020
compared to things like that,

1124
00:52:14,044 --> 00:52:16,044
it's definitely a light illustration.

1125
00:52:16,068 --> 00:52:18,328
The charm that comes out from light illustrations

1126
00:52:18,352 --> 00:52:21,035
is something that fascinates people more.

1127
00:52:21,149 --> 00:52:23,814
These days, people don't like detailed illustrations.

1128
00:52:23,876 --> 00:52:27,167
Light illustrations are popular.

1129
00:52:27,191 --> 00:52:29,667
What's important about that is,

1130
00:52:29,691 --> 00:52:32,307
how much information there is in the whole illustration.

1131
00:52:32,331 --> 00:52:35,347
I talked about the concept of seasoning food before.

1132
00:52:36,524 --> 00:52:39,132
If there's no seasoning, it's savory.

1133
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:41,007
If there's more seasoning, it's salty.

1134
00:52:41,031 --> 00:52:42,725
If there's even more seasoning, it's even saltier.

1135
00:52:43,084 --> 00:52:44,600
If there's more,

1136
00:52:44,624 --> 00:52:46,470
I'll just squeeze it and make it taste good.

1137
00:52:46,494 --> 00:52:48,763
Some points are appropriate from time to time.

1138
00:52:48,787 --> 00:52:50,086
If you just do that,

1139
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:51,793
illustrations can go anywhere.

1140
00:52:51,818 --> 00:52:53,367
Actually, what people like

1141
00:52:53,392 --> 00:52:54,578
is a mild taste.

1142
00:52:54,602 --> 00:52:57,230
In other words, people tend to like

1143
00:52:57,255 --> 00:52:58,381
illustrations with less information.

1144
00:52:58,405 --> 00:52:59,506
When you look at it...

1145
00:53:00,986 --> 00:53:02,986
So in the process of applying it,

1146
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:05,598
check if there's too much information in your illustration.

1147
00:53:05,862 --> 00:53:08,288
It's better to be careful about it.

1148
00:53:16,686 --> 00:53:18,686
When it comes to Form Shadows,

1149
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:20,015
it has a huge influence.

1150
00:53:20,039 --> 00:53:21,371
The Form Shadow earlier,

1151
00:53:21,395 --> 00:53:24,401
the reason why I said it's good to add a little bit of it to the edges...

1152
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:26,170
That's one of the reasons.

1153
00:53:26,272 --> 00:53:28,196
If you apply Form Shadows widely,

1154
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:29,892
the amount of light and shade increases.

1155
00:53:30,005 --> 00:53:32,097
So, there are more places where you have to look at the difference

1156
00:53:32,121 --> 00:53:33,983
between the light areas and the dark areas.

1157
00:53:34,007 --> 00:53:35,584
From the perspective of the viewers,

1158
00:53:35,608 --> 00:53:37,705
the amount of information will increase.

1159
00:53:38,387 --> 00:53:40,127
There's a lot to interpret.

1160
00:53:40,152 --> 00:53:42,214
If you look at it, it means that you have to look at the picture

1161
00:53:42,243 --> 00:53:43,899
while straining your eyes.

1162
00:53:44,146 --> 00:53:46,511
So in the end, it's kind of burdensome.

1163
00:53:46,674 --> 00:53:48,810
Regardless of whether it's good or bad,

1164
00:53:48,845 --> 00:53:50,914
when it's burdensome,

1165
00:53:50,938 --> 00:53:53,045
it won't be very popular.

1166
00:53:53,237 --> 00:53:55,300
You need to try and avoid this.

1167
00:54:05,773 --> 00:54:08,493
We're not going to complete it today.

1168
00:54:09,141 --> 00:54:11,473
I'm going to use a Form Shadow.

1169
00:54:11,497 --> 00:54:12,441
Let's move on...

1170
00:54:12,753 --> 00:54:14,570
After that, let's edit it

1171
00:54:14,594 --> 00:54:16,160
after adding some effects.

1172
00:54:27,198 --> 00:54:29,392
If you look at the overall density distribution,

1173
00:54:29,416 --> 00:54:31,953
there are a lot of details in the middle.

1174
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:34,643
There aren't that many details around the edges.

1175
00:54:34,727 --> 00:54:36,239
There's a tentacle in it,

1176
00:54:36,263 --> 00:54:37,991
but they went in big.

1177
00:54:38,187 --> 00:54:41,021
In terms of density, the characters and tentacles

1178
00:54:41,045 --> 00:54:42,600
are separated.

1179
00:54:44,805 --> 00:54:46,487
With detailed characters

1180
00:54:46,666 --> 00:54:48,189
and the simple tentacles,

1181
00:54:48,492 --> 00:54:50,220
and a bit more crowded background.

1182
00:54:50,661 --> 00:54:52,661
So these three things

1183
00:54:52,691 --> 00:54:54,076
can be distinguished from each other.

1184
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:55,984
It's an illustration like that.

1185
00:54:58,603 --> 00:55:01,135
The density distribution that I did when I drew the full illustration before.

1186
00:55:01,159 --> 00:55:02,435
Remember it well.

1187
00:55:05,484 --> 00:55:08,557
Is the density distribution high or low?

1188
00:55:08,581 --> 00:55:09,941
That's not important.

1189
00:55:09,965 --> 00:55:11,983
Make sure that the strong parts go in strongly

1190
00:55:12,007 --> 00:55:14,450
and the weak parts go in weakly.

1191
00:55:14,831 --> 00:55:17,128
It's important to control the strength and weaknesses.

1192
00:55:36,889 --> 00:55:38,498
Now, let's get started

1193
00:55:38,522 --> 00:55:39,894
with the background part, too.

1194
00:55:40,191 --> 00:55:41,953
As I said before, the background part...

1195
00:55:41,977 --> 00:55:44,542
There's almost no description of the tentacles in front of it.

1196
00:55:44,566 --> 00:55:46,451
So that it can be distinguished from the tentacles,

1197
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:47,868
the stone fragments in the back,

1198
00:55:47,892 --> 00:55:50,112
it's good to make them as small as possible.

1199
00:55:50,297 --> 00:55:52,921
Let's divide the density between the two

1200
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,277
by making the contrast big and detailed.

1201
00:56:13,816 --> 00:56:15,911
To make it as small as possible,

1202
00:56:15,935 --> 00:56:18,303
make the particles of the stone smaller.

1203
00:56:18,482 --> 00:56:19,994
I'm going to split it a lot.

1204
00:56:20,771 --> 00:56:22,651
I'm making a lot of dimensions.

1205
00:56:24,968 --> 00:56:27,132
If the number of dimensions increases, then naturally

1206
00:56:27,775 --> 00:56:29,403
it's going to be more dense.

1207
00:56:30,035 --> 00:56:31,666
Don't forget the density.

1208
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:32,863
Density is

1209
00:56:32,887 --> 00:56:34,671
about how dense it is.

1210
00:56:39,028 --> 00:56:41,132
It's important that it looks crowded.

1211
00:56:54,893 --> 00:56:57,210
The stones on the bottom are all crammed together.

1212
00:56:58,026 --> 00:57:00,815
For the direction, make sure to make it protrude as much as possible.

1213
00:57:00,839 --> 00:57:03,187
I hope it becomes an object

1214
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:04,627
where the silhouette of the character becomes a bit wider.

1215
00:57:07,167 --> 00:57:08,963
The directing

1216
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:11,027
down below too...

1217
00:57:11,051 --> 00:57:14,343
When I used to draw strong illustrations...

1218
00:57:14,367 --> 00:57:16,591
Let's utilize water effects.

1219
00:57:17,317 --> 00:57:19,900
Let's make something like a liquid,

1220
00:57:22,083 --> 00:57:23,656
at a relatively low area.

1221
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,507
The eye makes you concentrate a lot,

1222
00:57:26,531 --> 00:57:28,014
and there's a spark at the bottom.

1223
00:57:28,099 --> 00:57:29,252
So, not that.

1224
00:57:29,276 --> 00:57:31,636
There needs to be something to see around the edges, too.

1225
00:57:31,703 --> 00:57:33,488
So I used the point color

1226
00:57:33,512 --> 00:57:35,073
and made it an object that is the center of attention.

1227
00:57:35,302 --> 00:57:38,154
In monotone illustrations,

1228
00:57:38,178 --> 00:57:39,621
where whites and blacks are used a lot,

1229
00:57:39,646 --> 00:57:41,552
depending on the color arrangement,

1230
00:57:41,821 --> 00:57:43,020
and depending on the point color arrangement,

1231
00:57:43,044 --> 00:57:44,772
the gaze moves according to that.

1232
00:57:45,308 --> 00:57:47,244
The point colors that I put on the outer parts

1233
00:57:47,269 --> 00:57:49,102
are going to help

1234
00:57:49,126 --> 00:57:50,090
your eyes look out.

1235
00:57:54,583 --> 00:57:56,848
Continuing to the left one,

1236
00:57:56,873 --> 00:57:59,058
you have to be careful,

1237
00:57:59,082 --> 00:58:00,101
even when we do things like this, it doesn't become regular.

1238
00:58:04,248 --> 00:58:06,312
People are more 'mechanical' than you think.

1239
00:58:06,682 --> 00:58:08,756
The heartbeat, for instance,

1240
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:10,564
is a very precise tempo.

1241
00:58:12,173 --> 00:58:14,272
The reason why we like music is

1242
00:58:14,296 --> 00:58:16,022
and rhythm,

1243
00:58:16,046 --> 00:58:18,148
is because of our heartbeat.

1244
00:58:20,492 --> 00:58:23,260
It means people like

1245
00:58:23,285 --> 00:58:25,045
a mechanical tempo.

1246
00:58:28,472 --> 00:58:30,210
So, even when you're drawing,

1247
00:58:30,212 --> 00:58:31,272
you could be carried away like that.

1248
00:58:31,732 --> 00:58:33,433
When you draw irregular items,

1249
00:58:33,457 --> 00:58:35,408
you need to be careful.

1250
00:58:37,463 --> 00:58:38,634
When it comes to things like this,

1251
00:58:38,658 --> 00:58:41,067
I say this to my students.

1252
00:58:41,201 --> 00:58:42,891
Don't trust yourself.

1253
00:58:43,166 --> 00:58:45,352
But because you don't trust yourself,

1254
00:58:45,376 --> 00:58:47,534
I believe that you will be able to trust yourself later on.

1255
00:58:47,708 --> 00:58:49,125
For example,

1256
00:58:49,149 --> 00:58:52,233
there will be people

1257
00:58:52,258 --> 00:58:53,620
who can't wake up in the morning

1258
00:58:54,001 --> 00:58:55,018
I'm like that.

1259
00:58:55,136 --> 00:58:57,350
What do we do if we can't wake up in the morning?

1260
00:58:57,374 --> 00:59:00,380
We set about 10 alarms.

1261
00:59:00,698 --> 00:59:02,880
We build about 10 defenses.

1262
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:05,710
If you don't wake up, the alarm will keep going off until you wake up.

1263
00:59:06,341 --> 00:59:07,451
And so,

1264
00:59:07,475 --> 00:59:09,426
eventually, we can get up.

1265
00:59:09,627 --> 00:59:12,367
Because I'm not going to wake up,

1266
00:59:12,391 --> 00:59:13,632
I set the alarm,

1267
00:59:13,656 --> 00:59:15,168
and because I set the alarm,

1268
00:59:15,192 --> 00:59:17,066
I can believe that I'll eventually wake up in the morning.

1269
00:59:17,090 --> 00:59:18,226
That's what it's like.

1270
00:59:18,467 --> 00:59:19,990
It's the same when you draw.

1271
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:22,144
If you often make mistakes in a certain area,

1272
00:59:22,168 --> 00:59:23,673
and if you know that,

1273
00:59:23,697 --> 00:59:26,396
you can be careful in advance

1274
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:27,758
because you would have made a mistake in that area before.

1275
00:59:27,782 --> 00:59:30,531
I'm going to make a mistake again, so I'll be careful not to.

1276
00:59:30,555 --> 00:59:32,555
If you recognize it in advance,

1277
00:59:32,579 --> 00:59:34,652
you'll be able to move on without making that mistake.

1278
00:59:36,595 --> 00:59:38,514
The flame part in the middle

1279
00:59:38,538 --> 00:59:41,248
is the area where the particles are concentrated and the density is high.

1280
00:59:41,361 --> 00:59:43,548
If you look at the arrangement of the areas that need to be dense,

1281
00:59:43,572 --> 00:59:45,919
the character's face should go in the strongest,

1282
00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:48,347
and the skirt in the middle should go in weakly.

1283
00:59:48,372 --> 00:59:50,104
The flame at the bottom should have a medium amount of density.

1284
00:59:50,239 --> 00:59:52,817
Then the order of strong, medium, and weak is

1285
00:59:52,841 --> 00:59:53,843
established.

1286
00:59:58,034 --> 01:00:00,138
Rather than using them neatly side by side.

1287
01:00:00,162 --> 01:00:02,409
It's good to mix them together.

1288
01:00:05,618 --> 01:00:08,520
We're going to edit it as a whole.

1289
01:00:08,615 --> 01:00:10,207
In order to edit,

1290
01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:11,388
at the bottom part of the flame,

1291
01:00:11,412 --> 01:00:13,809
I'm going to put in fireworks like that.

1292
01:00:13,983 --> 01:00:15,763
The way I used it is similar.

1293
01:00:15,788 --> 01:00:18,430
I'll apply the Screen Layer and change the color as I want.

1294
01:00:18,866 --> 01:00:20,808
I'll adjust the Contrast as I want.

1295
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:25,261
You can use it just how you want.

1296
01:00:25,546 --> 01:00:28,235
You can change the shape with the Smudge Tool.

1297
01:00:28,359 --> 01:00:30,359
And you can use something similar

1298
01:00:30,634 --> 01:00:33,001
and make a flame at the bottom.

1299
01:00:33,253 --> 01:00:35,004
Let's keep adding effects.

1300
01:00:35,088 --> 01:00:37,303
I'm sure you remember all the tools you're using now.

1301
01:00:37,327 --> 01:00:40,687
Ctrl+6, B, M

1302
01:00:42,183 --> 01:00:44,106
I brought the flame texture, too.

1303
01:00:45,212 --> 01:00:47,839
I'm going to put it in so that it becomes a dotted particle.

1304
01:00:48,013 --> 01:00:49,920
There are many lines in the illustration.

1305
01:00:49,944 --> 01:00:52,688
There are many tentacles, and there are fireworks on this side.

1306
01:00:52,712 --> 01:00:55,029
There are many lines, so to fit them in,

1307
01:00:55,054 --> 01:00:57,214
you'll need to make sure that you have some dot elements.

1308
01:00:57,615 --> 01:01:00,283
Let's add the dots like that.

1309
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:05,026
One of the parts that I need to catch up on is...

1310
01:01:05,050 --> 01:01:07,945
for portrait illustrations,

1311
01:01:07,969 --> 01:01:09,279
as I said before,

1312
01:01:09,303 --> 01:01:12,582
since the background is transparent,

1313
01:01:12,606 --> 01:01:15,551
if it goes outside of the canvas,

1314
01:01:15,575 --> 01:01:18,229
when I turn off the background,

1315
01:01:18,253 --> 01:01:19,814
that side will be still black.

1316
01:01:21,255 --> 01:01:22,928
If you turn off the bottom background,

1317
01:01:22,953 --> 01:01:24,558
can you see how the Screen Layer

1318
01:01:24,582 --> 01:01:26,388
is sticking out in a square shape?

1319
01:01:26,412 --> 01:01:28,620
You have to erase all those parts later.

1320
01:01:29,888 --> 01:01:32,102
When you make this picture transparent,

1321
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:35,138
you have to make sure there are no unnatural parts.

1322
01:01:35,162 --> 01:01:36,639
Let's be careful

1323
01:01:36,663 --> 01:01:37,766
when you work on it.

1324
01:01:42,426 --> 01:01:43,486
We don't know what kind of image the background will be

1325
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:45,668
for these illustrations.

1326
01:01:50,485 --> 01:01:52,577
I'll continue to use glitter

1327
01:01:52,601 --> 01:01:54,240
and I'm going to add more particles.

1328
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:57,911
I added some dot elements.

1329
01:01:59,141 --> 01:02:02,236
It makes the particle size look smaller,

1330
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:05,205
and it raises the quality.

1331
01:02:12,221 --> 01:02:13,921
The parts where the sparkles are placed

1332
01:02:13,945 --> 01:02:15,121
close to the character's face,

1333
01:02:15,145 --> 01:02:16,801
I'm going to put them in as much as possible.

1334
01:02:19,204 --> 01:02:21,068
If there's something you don't like,

1335
01:02:21,099 --> 01:02:22,698
you can put the sparkles in

1336
01:02:22,722 --> 01:02:23,906
by yourself.

1337
01:02:24,475 --> 01:02:25,871
When you do it,

1338
01:02:25,895 --> 01:02:27,716
if you use the Outer Glow effect,

1339
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:28,876
it will work pretty well.

1340
01:02:35,803 --> 01:02:38,493
For the parts that are lacking,

1341
01:02:38,708 --> 01:02:39,971
add some more sparkles, too.

1342
01:02:40,036 --> 01:02:42,615
It's okay to touch it with a Smudge Tool from time to time.

1343
01:02:44,933 --> 01:02:46,485
I'll put in an Overlay Layer

1344
01:02:47,296 --> 01:02:49,496
between the creature and the background.

1345
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:50,476
I'll add some light.

1346
01:02:50,547 --> 01:02:52,970
I'm going to make sure that the area is more distinguished.

1347
01:02:53,137 --> 01:02:54,935
It'll make the illustration look good.

1348
01:02:58,335 --> 01:02:59,603
When you add Overlay,

1349
01:02:59,627 --> 01:03:01,436
you'll put it in first.

1350
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:03,299
Then, adjust the Opacity,

1351
01:03:05,322 --> 01:03:08,167
then you can adjust the information.

1352
01:03:22,841 --> 01:03:24,791
Bring some more fireworks

1353
01:03:25,932 --> 01:03:28,247
and place them at the back.

1354
01:03:28,271 --> 01:03:31,588
So, between the tentacles and the background,

1355
01:03:31,612 --> 01:03:34,010
it's like a haze

1356
01:03:36,275 --> 01:03:37,551
and it kind of looks like smoke.

1357
01:03:37,575 --> 01:03:39,641
I thought it'd be nice to have something like a haze.

1358
01:03:39,666 --> 01:03:41,450
So I put it in like that.

1359
01:03:41,474 --> 01:03:43,475
Use the Smudge Tool to make a shape.

1360
01:03:43,751 --> 01:03:45,296
I'm going to use the color I want.

1361
01:03:46,437 --> 01:03:48,367
I'll use a navy color.

1362
01:03:49,544 --> 01:03:51,492
There's a reason for that.

1363
01:03:54,797 --> 01:03:57,099
Since navy is a color with low intrinsic density,

1364
01:03:57,124 --> 01:03:59,261
and since it's a dark color,

1365
01:03:59,285 --> 01:04:00,862
I put it on the outside.

1366
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:02,965
Turquoise is in the middle.

1367
01:04:03,098 --> 01:04:05,244
The middle is bright and the border area is dark.

1368
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:07,900
I made that difference with the hues.

1369
01:04:08,242 --> 01:04:09,443
The middle is turquoise,

1370
01:04:09,467 --> 01:04:10,504
the border is navy.

1371
01:04:15,818 --> 01:04:16,839
Even when it's edited,

1372
01:04:16,863 --> 01:04:18,284
in the end, it's the same theory.

1373
01:04:18,783 --> 01:04:20,511
On the bottom part that lacks something,

1374
01:04:20,535 --> 01:04:22,444
to draw more attention,

1375
01:04:23,149 --> 01:04:25,530
you can see that it looks more completed

1376
01:04:25,561 --> 01:04:26,780
compared to the first time I drew the whole thing.

1377
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:29,964
This is about 70% completed.

1378
01:04:37,272 --> 01:04:39,272
Add some more sparkles.

1379
01:04:44,165 --> 01:04:47,210
The overall silhouette looks a bit small.

1380
01:04:47,234 --> 01:04:49,144
In the background,

1381
01:04:49,168 --> 01:04:51,611
I can add a bit of a fog effect, too.

1382
01:04:51,719 --> 01:04:54,547
I'm going to make a big diamond silhouette from left to right.

1383
01:04:54,571 --> 01:04:56,481
That's how you make

1384
01:04:56,505 --> 01:04:57,887
the drawing more complete.

1385
01:04:58,269 --> 01:05:01,201
So, we described an illustration today.

1386
01:05:01,361 --> 01:05:02,640
If you do portrait illustration,

1387
01:05:02,664 --> 01:05:04,418
just like this,

1388
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:06,885
you can actually complete

1389
01:05:06,909 --> 01:05:08,037
an actual illustration that you can use for practical work.

1390
01:05:08,061 --> 01:05:10,264
So, when you are working on description,

1391
01:05:10,288 --> 01:05:12,692
it's good to pay attention to these parts.

1392
01:05:13,432 --> 01:05:14,918
Keep up the great work.

1393
01:05:15,269 --> 01:05:16,520
This is the end of today's lecture.
