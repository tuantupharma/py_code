2
00:00:06,867 --> 00:00:07,890
Hello.

3
00:00:07,977 --> 00:00:11,164
Today, I'm going to show you the sketches I worked on before I worked on the portrait illustration.

4
00:00:11,715 --> 00:00:15,466
With these two things,

5
00:00:16,503 --> 00:00:18,651
I'm going to use different colors depending on the mood

6
00:00:18,675 --> 00:00:21,495
and I'm also going to analyze how it's directed.

7
00:00:24,142 --> 00:00:25,867
Using both sketches at the same time,

8
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:28,113
for a cute vibe.

9
00:00:28,138 --> 00:00:30,563
The one on the right has a bigger scale.

10
00:00:30,588 --> 00:00:31,955
I think using the one on the left

11
00:00:31,956 --> 00:00:33,884
will be easier to show it as an example.

12
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:35,093
I brought both of them.

13
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:37,695
I'll describe the one on the right later.

14
00:00:37,696 --> 00:00:39,617
I'm also going to complete it.

15
00:00:39,788 --> 00:00:41,594
So, I drew the outlines and brought it.

16
00:00:41,804 --> 00:00:43,266
Let's get started.

17
00:00:43,913 --> 00:00:45,800
Compared to when I worked on the full illustration,

18
00:00:45,801 --> 00:00:48,155
there are many similar principles that apply.

19
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,435
In the end, the principles used in painting,

20
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,318
it's the repetition of the same principles.

21
00:00:52,342 --> 00:00:54,380
When you use cute elements,

22
00:00:54,405 --> 00:00:56,497
you can make the main element closer to the sub elements.

23
00:00:56,521 --> 00:00:58,216
Make the silhouette round

24
00:00:58,241 --> 00:00:59,810
or place a lot of objects.

25
00:00:59,835 --> 00:01:01,036
In the end, it's like this.

26
00:01:01,107 --> 00:01:02,529
Let's use it.

27
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:09,246
Let's make the one on the left cuter.

28
00:01:12,136 --> 00:01:15,317
As expected of the concept, for the sharp bottom teeth,

29
00:01:18,082 --> 00:01:19,871
it'd be nice to change them to make it look cuter.

30
00:01:27,613 --> 00:01:30,416
It's closer to being bright than cute right now.

31
00:01:30,441 --> 00:01:31,918
I'll get to it.

32
00:01:33,285 --> 00:01:34,300
The facial expression, too.

33
00:01:41,371 --> 00:01:43,379
It'd be nice if it gets brighter.

34
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,989
Previously, it was a triangular composition.

35
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,488
I used the inverted triangular composition.

36
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:51,550
With cute characters,

37
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,215
there's a lot of elements up on the top.

38
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,800
Their silhouettes are

39
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:56,933
close to an inverted triangular composition.

40
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:00,520
While maintaining that,

41
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,347
when we do illustrations for mobile games,

42
00:02:04,372 --> 00:02:06,019
they need some fanciness.

43
00:02:06,395 --> 00:02:09,105
You need something fancy to stimulate the desire to buy it.

44
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:12,207
I said to maintain the diamond silhouette.

45
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:16,019
And since the inverted triangle itself is less stable,

46
00:02:17,128 --> 00:02:19,636
without ruining the stability,

47
00:02:19,661 --> 00:02:21,949
it's all about placing things on the top.

48
00:02:22,371 --> 00:02:23,941
I'm going to place things around.

49
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:27,949
It's one of the effective ways to focus objects on the top.

50
00:02:27,988 --> 00:02:30,816
The size of the objects like hats

51
00:02:30,841 --> 00:02:32,504
can be made bigger.

52
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,925
If every single element in an illustration contains

53
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,933
big elements that are round and cute,

54
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:40,597
it's easier for the character to look cuter.

55
00:02:40,863 --> 00:02:44,392
Small characters and big outfits.

56
00:02:44,535 --> 00:02:46,293
They're used together a lot.

57
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:51,386
When young characters are in a game,

58
00:02:51,411 --> 00:02:53,543
they're usually wearing a lot of big outfits,

59
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:56,246
to emphasize a cute mood.

60
00:02:56,271 --> 00:02:57,533
That's how it works.

61
00:03:01,668 --> 00:03:03,715
The silhouette will be

62
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:05,808
a little bit rounder than the original.

63
00:03:06,004 --> 00:03:07,184
Let's change it.

64
00:03:20,996 --> 00:03:23,707
If you're drawing a cute character,

65
00:03:23,731 --> 00:03:26,332
if you do that, try your best and check

66
00:03:26,357 --> 00:03:29,480
if all the silhouettes are round.

67
00:03:32,285 --> 00:03:34,074
Even when you draw the hair,

68
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:35,216
make it a bit puffy.

69
00:03:35,241 --> 00:03:36,763
Make it weighty somehow.

70
00:03:50,691 --> 00:03:53,266
And to put a lot of elements on top,

71
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,817
it's okay to add something more.

72
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,300
I'll raise this line up.

73
00:04:02,441 --> 00:04:04,238
Change the hand gesture.

74
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:11,947
Here.

75
00:04:12,472 --> 00:04:15,480
Let's add one more tentacle.

76
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:28,938
When we were composing the previous portrait illustration,

77
00:04:28,962 --> 00:04:31,600
between making the character calm and the background flashy,

78
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:34,204
and making the characters fancy and the background a bit calm,

79
00:04:34,282 --> 00:04:36,930
when you're trying to create a more active character,

80
00:04:36,955 --> 00:04:40,141
it would be better to make the character more active, right?

81
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,305
So, the character's posture itself

82
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,704
should be dynamic.

83
00:04:55,813 --> 00:04:59,672
Then, the pose that looks like it's walking forward

84
00:04:59,697 --> 00:05:01,493
is the foundation pose.

85
00:05:01,517 --> 00:05:03,079
It's a very calm posture.

86
00:05:03,104 --> 00:05:06,525
I don't know how I can give that sense of danger

87
00:05:06,618 --> 00:05:08,197
How will I give

88
00:05:08,222 --> 00:05:09,657
a bouncy atmosphere?

89
00:05:09,682 --> 00:05:10,908
I'll think about it, too.

90
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,119
It's the same thing we learned before.

91
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,119
You have to bend the ends of

92
00:05:16,144 --> 00:05:17,633
the flow of the gaze.

93
00:05:23,983 --> 00:05:26,638
If you just remember

94
00:05:26,662 --> 00:05:27,626
what I told you in class,

95
00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:30,833
to express the feeling you want in the illustration,

96
00:05:30,857 --> 00:05:32,721
it's not that hard.

97
00:05:37,126 --> 00:05:39,445
But while drawing on the spot...

98
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,415
While you're drawing,

99
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,103
if you think this isn't that cute, so I'll add this kind of vibe...

100
00:05:44,128 --> 00:05:46,900
The process of making that kind of decision itself can be difficult.

101
00:05:48,728 --> 00:05:51,908
It's not something that's theoretically difficult.

102
00:05:57,165 --> 00:05:58,814
Bend its waist a bit.

103
00:06:02,908 --> 00:06:05,259
Lift one leg backwards.

104
00:06:22,088 --> 00:06:23,712
The stronger the moves are,

105
00:06:23,745 --> 00:06:25,431
the more the character will look active.

106
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:28,658
The reason why I used the example on my left is

107
00:06:28,683 --> 00:06:31,300
the right one is big in scale.

108
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,869
Big and small scale.

109
00:06:32,902 --> 00:06:34,462
If I have to choose between the two,

110
00:06:34,462 --> 00:06:36,533
it's hard to choose the former one.

111
00:06:36,557 --> 00:06:38,493
If it's too big, it'll look much too cool.

112
00:06:38,844 --> 00:06:41,533
That's why I used the smaller one, but also,

113
00:06:41,557 --> 00:06:43,557
the posture of the character

114
00:06:43,582 --> 00:06:45,408
should be strong.

115
00:06:45,432 --> 00:06:46,833
The one on the right is...

116
00:06:46,857 --> 00:06:48,672
When it comes to that,

117
00:06:48,697 --> 00:06:49,998
there are some limitations.

118
00:06:50,023 --> 00:06:52,211
That's another reason why I used the one on the left.

119
00:06:53,438 --> 00:06:56,256
It's just that there's a limit.

120
00:06:56,437 --> 00:06:58,500
Raise this leg up like this.

121
00:07:00,071 --> 00:07:02,156
I'll lift up one side like this.

122
00:07:03,648 --> 00:07:05,457
Make it pose dynamically, or

123
00:07:05,482 --> 00:07:07,531
you can do that, too.

124
00:07:07,882 --> 00:07:10,406
Let's take an example with the left character.

125
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:14,508
To make its legs look more dynamic,

126
00:07:14,533 --> 00:07:16,117
Let's cross them a little.

127
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,430
The character doesn't have to be on the floor all the time.

128
00:07:42,097 --> 00:07:43,008
Like this.

129
00:07:43,033 --> 00:07:45,922
Let's do it like it's floating in the air.

130
00:07:46,765 --> 00:07:48,296
Open its mouth slightly.

131
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:05,781
Open the character's mouth wide,

132
00:08:07,406 --> 00:08:10,201
to make the character as dynamic as possible.

133
00:08:21,716 --> 00:08:23,449
This hand holding the weapon...

134
00:08:23,474 --> 00:08:25,404
If it's drooping down,

135
00:08:25,451 --> 00:08:27,505
it will make the character feel more calm.

136
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,083
So,

137
00:08:29,185 --> 00:08:31,216
as expected, like what we did before,

138
00:08:32,966 --> 00:08:34,927
I'll cross the gaze with the character

139
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,318
to give off a bouncy look.

140
00:08:49,137 --> 00:08:51,349
The bottom is balanced,

141
00:08:52,068 --> 00:08:53,748
But if there's too much balance,

142
00:08:53,773 --> 00:08:54,920
it becomes an illustration

143
00:08:54,945 --> 00:08:56,357
where the silhouette is triangular.

144
00:08:56,382 --> 00:08:57,451
Be careful not to do that.

145
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,201
I'm going to control the description of the bottom.

146
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,229
Instead, I'm going to use the remaining information.

147
00:09:12,104 --> 00:09:14,839
It'd be nice to fill in the top with different elements.

148
00:09:30,699 --> 00:09:33,253
I think it'll be good to add some settings to the character.

149
00:09:33,277 --> 00:09:34,878
This character has sharp teeth.

150
00:09:34,903 --> 00:09:38,026
Most of the creatures around it are mouth-shaped,

151
00:09:38,051 --> 00:09:39,823
so I can make them love food.

152
00:09:40,417 --> 00:09:42,957
It's not that it's important to apply the setting itself.

153
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,549
With that setting,

154
00:09:44,574 --> 00:09:47,426
it's important that you can put in cute items.

155
00:09:48,457 --> 00:09:50,510
I used it when I drew the full illustration.

156
00:09:50,535 --> 00:09:51,722
Like drawing takoyaki.

157
00:10:18,513 --> 00:10:20,681
And various snacks and foods.

158
00:10:20,706 --> 00:10:22,112
Place them around.

159
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:34,767
Let's add as many elements as possible.

160
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,173
When I'm trying to make a cute character,

161
00:10:40,198 --> 00:10:42,478
the drawing itself needs to be a bit chaotic

162
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:43,900
when you look at it.

163
00:10:44,908 --> 00:10:46,314
It needs to feel a bit loud.

164
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:48,494
It's not that the character's

165
00:10:49,697 --> 00:10:51,298
voice is loud.

166
00:10:51,323 --> 00:10:52,329
It's that it looks noisy.

167
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:53,548
It needs to be like this.

168
00:11:00,921 --> 00:11:02,233
Draw a gift box.

169
00:11:10,494 --> 00:11:13,291
It's good to draw snacks that we eat often, too.

170
00:11:27,705 --> 00:11:30,025
Or fast food,

171
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:35,509
like pizza

172
00:11:54,861 --> 00:11:56,104
or chicken.

173
00:12:04,189 --> 00:12:06,408
I'll place as many different elements as possible around the character.

174
00:12:06,433 --> 00:12:07,820
But what you need to be careful of is,

175
00:12:07,845 --> 00:12:09,408
so that it's not placed too evenly,

176
00:12:10,829 --> 00:12:13,501
and when you place a lot of items with dot elements,

177
00:12:13,526 --> 00:12:15,705
don't just place them on one side.

178
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:18,704
Placing it while touching the landscape

179
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:19,729
is more effective.

180
00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:24,970
If you place objects repeatedly

181
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:26,376
around its back and front,

182
00:12:26,401 --> 00:12:29,236
it creates a space near the character.

183
00:12:29,501 --> 00:12:31,251
When configuring portrait illustration,

184
00:12:31,276 --> 00:12:33,923
it's very important to show that space.

185
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:36,367
Since there aren't many elements

186
00:12:36,392 --> 00:12:37,837
that can express a three-dimensional effect,

187
00:12:37,861 --> 00:12:41,037
I couldn't show you the space around it.

188
00:12:41,062 --> 00:12:42,336
So, I can't draw the background.

189
00:12:42,482 --> 00:12:44,653
I can show it indirectly.

190
00:12:44,678 --> 00:12:46,748
These objects become very important.

191
00:12:48,217 --> 00:12:50,217
So, I think it's a good idea to have all these factors around it

192
00:12:50,241 --> 00:12:52,209
in the space where this character is standing,

193
00:12:52,234 --> 00:12:53,686
so that you can guess.

194
00:13:00,467 --> 00:13:02,514
Let's continue to get the vibe right.

195
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:24,388
It's not good to add too many dot elements.

196
00:13:24,413 --> 00:13:25,902
When you place it on a dot, line, or plane,

197
00:13:25,927 --> 00:13:28,506
it's good if there's a balance between the dots, lines, and planes.

198
00:13:28,544 --> 00:13:31,239
Since we added a lot of dot elements,

199
00:13:31,264 --> 00:13:33,200
it'd be nice to include linear elements.

200
00:13:33,888 --> 00:13:36,614
What would make the character look cute?

201
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,318
You can add ribbons.

202
00:13:42,911 --> 00:13:44,644
If possible, you can see most of the items

203
00:13:44,669 --> 00:13:47,310
are arranged in a warm color.

204
00:13:47,372 --> 00:13:49,615
When I talk about the temperature of colors,

205
00:13:49,771 --> 00:13:50,592
warm colors

206
00:13:50,616 --> 00:13:51,672
are effective when

207
00:13:51,672 --> 00:13:53,794
you want to show something cute.

208
00:13:53,819 --> 00:13:56,130
It'll be effective when you want to make a warm feeling.

209
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,169
The overall color, too.

210
00:14:06,194 --> 00:14:09,263
It's good to use a red tone like this.

211
00:14:31,647 --> 00:14:33,834
If I add a bit of coloring,

212
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,983
portrait illustration has limited lighting, so

213
00:14:40,008 --> 00:14:42,427
most of the time, I use the frontal light a lot.

214
00:14:42,795 --> 00:14:45,209
I use a lot of frontal light

215
00:14:45,233 --> 00:14:47,077
Or a side light.

216
00:14:47,397 --> 00:14:49,733
There are times when I use Backlight,

217
00:14:49,757 --> 00:14:50,867
but even when I use Backlight,

218
00:14:50,892 --> 00:14:53,186
because there's a condition

219
00:14:53,211 --> 00:14:54,467
that you need to see the character's design at a glance,

220
00:14:54,491 --> 00:14:57,319
the light from the front is always strong.

221
00:14:57,491 --> 00:15:00,412
If we don't light up the front and light up the back,

222
00:15:00,437 --> 00:15:02,233
you can't see the character.

223
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,178
If that happens,

224
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:05,569
we need to feel the charm of this character

225
00:15:05,594 --> 00:15:06,584
to want to buy it.

226
00:15:06,616 --> 00:15:08,389
If you don't feel that charm anymore

227
00:15:08,414 --> 00:15:10,240
the thing you want to emphasize won't be emphasized.

228
00:15:10,305 --> 00:15:11,998
So when you make a portrait illustration,

229
00:15:12,023 --> 00:15:14,803
no matter what, the lighting in the front should be strong.

230
00:15:15,301 --> 00:15:16,892
In that situation, what we learned last time...

231
00:15:16,924 --> 00:15:18,695
Soft Light, Hard Light,

232
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,187
it's okay to think about it.

233
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,267
There's a lot of information about the character.

234
00:15:22,292 --> 00:15:24,034
If you want to give a serious look,

235
00:15:24,058 --> 00:15:25,700
Soft Light is just right.

236
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:28,467
If there's not a lot of information about the character,

237
00:15:28,491 --> 00:15:30,629
if you want to make it look more casual,

238
00:15:30,676 --> 00:15:32,637
Hard Light would be better.

239
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:34,215
Then right now,

240
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,387
in the current situation where I want to give a cute vibe,

241
00:15:36,412 --> 00:15:38,825
I think the best one is Hard Light.

242
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,949
As much as that, when you apply shadows,

243
00:15:48,332 --> 00:15:49,371
if possible,

244
00:15:51,043 --> 00:15:51,934
make it look

245
00:15:53,106 --> 00:15:54,817
strong.

246
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,184
Do that.

247
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,270
There's a lot of information in view.

248
00:16:04,295 --> 00:16:06,317
If it's already loud,

249
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,809
you can add less shadow.

250
00:16:07,904 --> 00:16:09,388
Adjust the direction of the light.

251
00:16:09,895 --> 00:16:11,809
But if what you drew is simple

252
00:16:11,834 --> 00:16:13,687
you can adjust the direction of the light.

253
00:16:13,712 --> 00:16:15,922
Give lighting with a lot of shadows

254
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,600
In other words, when there is a lot of information around,

255
00:16:19,624 --> 00:16:22,303
I'm going to do it as close as possible to the light from the front.

256
00:16:22,373 --> 00:16:24,327
But if the character looks a bit boring,

257
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:26,100
I'll try to apply as much light as I can on the side,

258
00:16:26,124 --> 00:16:29,266
and from the top, so that there's a lot of shadow.

259
00:16:29,805 --> 00:16:32,062
That's how you can adjust the information.

260
00:17:12,562 --> 00:17:14,522
If the tentacles are long

261
00:17:14,547 --> 00:17:16,437
and if it's a curved shape,

262
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:19,133
I don't think it's cute.

263
00:17:19,157 --> 00:17:20,844
The silhouette that gives off a cute vibe

264
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:23,000
will be round silhouettes.

265
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:26,375
Think about children.

266
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,609
Most of kids' outfits look like that.

267
00:17:28,634 --> 00:17:30,400
The kids themselves look like that, too.

268
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:32,251
Small and round.

269
00:17:32,282 --> 00:17:34,421
Remember the shape and apply it.

270
00:17:41,209 --> 00:17:44,012
So that it can look cute with party items.

271
00:17:44,037 --> 00:17:45,600
Make it bite it in the mouth.

272
00:17:46,788 --> 00:17:48,585
You can use that kind of composition, too.

273
00:17:52,764 --> 00:17:54,912
Or if the character is wearing sunglasses...

274
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:01,803
The texture of the food...

275
00:18:03,302 --> 00:18:04,764
You can use it freely.

276
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:07,553
It's one of the good things about creating a cute character.

277
00:18:07,578 --> 00:18:08,905
I'm looking at it because it's fun.

278
00:18:12,246 --> 00:18:15,256
Dot sunglasses that were very popular in the past.

279
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,083
Since there are a lot of elements around it,

280
00:18:32,108 --> 00:18:33,819
the character

281
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,592
is emphasized quite well.

282
00:18:42,178 --> 00:18:45,030
If you open its eyes wide, it will look cuter.

283
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,418
It's like a cartoon.

284
00:19:31,639 --> 00:19:33,732
It's a good idea

285
00:19:34,169 --> 00:19:36,256
to put a glittering effect.

286
00:19:36,818 --> 00:19:39,115
It keeps increasing the cuteness of the illustration.

287
00:19:39,348 --> 00:19:43,686
And one of the biggest advantages of this glitter effect is

288
00:19:43,711 --> 00:19:46,350
it's very small.

289
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,085
Why is it good?

290
00:19:48,109 --> 00:19:50,631
We're going to talk about particles.

291
00:19:51,154 --> 00:19:54,319
If the particles in the picture are big,

292
00:19:54,343 --> 00:19:56,505
Literally, it looks like the resolution is a bit low.

293
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,202
That's what happens.

294
00:19:58,709 --> 00:20:02,405
It might look like I stopped drawing halfway.

295
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:05,395
Because of that, the drawing...

296
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,559
If it doesn't improve much,

297
00:20:07,584 --> 00:20:10,499
it's good to pay attention to the particle size.

298
00:20:10,531 --> 00:20:11,936
These glitters

299
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:15,067
act as a small particle

300
00:20:15,277 --> 00:20:16,912
because the size itself is small.

301
00:20:17,803 --> 00:20:19,334
If these go in,

302
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:21,537
it means that the quality of the picture looks higher.

303
00:20:24,309 --> 00:20:26,500
This person paid more attention to coloring.

304
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,202
That's how it feels.

305
00:20:29,593 --> 00:20:32,984
I actually rely a lot on glitter because of that.

306
00:20:33,009 --> 00:20:34,039
Because with artists,

307
00:20:36,505 --> 00:20:37,733
depending on the person,

308
00:20:37,757 --> 00:20:40,402
I saw them fill in the details with glitter.

309
00:20:40,427 --> 00:20:41,825
It's fake detail.

310
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:43,608
That's not real detail.

311
00:20:43,633 --> 00:20:45,500
There are people who express that, too.

312
00:20:47,257 --> 00:20:50,500
But whether it's real or fake, there's no harm in using it.

313
00:20:50,524 --> 00:20:52,162
It's just that you shouldn't use it too much.

314
00:20:52,513 --> 00:20:54,295
I'll use it according to the situation.

315
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,733
To strengthen the feeling that you want.

316
00:20:57,467 --> 00:20:59,076
If the fake details sparkle,

317
00:20:59,101 --> 00:21:00,367
what are the real details?

318
00:21:00,391 --> 00:21:03,631
The fact that it's good to make these things into objects.

319
00:21:03,678 --> 00:21:04,834
That was the theory.

320
00:21:04,872 --> 00:21:07,647
For example, the small candy that I put in earlier.

321
00:21:07,648 --> 00:21:08,656
Things like that.

322
00:21:08,757 --> 00:21:10,084
With objects that have a three-dimensional effect,

323
00:21:10,109 --> 00:21:12,000
it's better to add details.

324
00:21:12,024 --> 00:21:13,037
That was the message.

325
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,225
But you don't have to stick to that.

326
00:21:17,803 --> 00:21:19,951
It's good if there's a bit of a three-dimensionality to it.

327
00:21:19,984 --> 00:21:21,397
Of course, there's an advantage.

328
00:21:21,591 --> 00:21:23,825
You can see the space better.

329
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,225
You can see through it better.

330
00:21:25,249 --> 00:21:27,133
That's one good thing about it.

331
00:21:27,157 --> 00:21:29,139
It's not impossible because of the glitter.

332
00:21:36,091 --> 00:21:38,201
I'll try to make it as yellow as possible.

333
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,083
I'm going to increase the warm colors

334
00:21:44,108 --> 00:21:46,288
to add a warm feeling to the drawing.

335
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,241
Even the belts on this side...

336
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,601
It's good to make the flow as strong as possible.

337
00:21:59,716 --> 00:22:01,467
With the hair,

338
00:22:01,492 --> 00:22:03,389
it's good to make it blow in the wind.

339
00:22:16,405 --> 00:22:18,007
If you do it like this,

340
00:22:18,031 --> 00:22:19,500
compared to before,

341
00:22:21,695 --> 00:22:23,217
if you compare it like this...

342
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:24,318
Before,

343
00:22:24,655 --> 00:22:26,256
and after.

344
00:22:26,529 --> 00:22:27,867
The mood is definitely a bit

345
00:22:27,891 --> 00:22:29,514
warmer.

346
00:22:36,184 --> 00:22:39,133
When I drew the full illustration of cute characters,

347
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:40,334
what was it about?

348
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:42,061
The picture needs to look shiny.

349
00:22:42,086 --> 00:22:43,873
That means there should be a lot of highlights.

350
00:22:43,898 --> 00:22:45,623
Because they're applied here, too.

351
00:22:50,715 --> 00:22:52,811
So that a lot of highlights can go in,

352
00:22:59,896 --> 00:23:02,014
let's set the coloring method.

353
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:42,303
If you keep adjusting it,

354
00:23:44,873 --> 00:23:48,029
it's going to be a cute illustration.

355
00:24:05,281 --> 00:24:07,331
But when you use different colors,

356
00:24:07,356 --> 00:24:09,326
what if the balance doesn't match?

357
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,888
You could worry about it.

358
00:24:10,913 --> 00:24:12,855
Do you remember

359
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,388
the contrast between warm and cool colors?

360
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:16,529
Now, you can use it here.

361
00:24:16,553 --> 00:24:18,200
If one system has strong saturation,

362
00:24:18,224 --> 00:24:20,724
and the other side has low saturation, it's fine.

363
00:24:20,727 --> 00:24:21,734
In this case,

364
00:24:21,735 --> 00:24:24,299
as the color of the reddish objects was strong,

365
00:24:24,324 --> 00:24:26,833
so that the saturation of the blue objects doesn't get too high,

366
00:24:26,857 --> 00:24:28,521
if you work on it while being careful,

367
00:24:29,505 --> 00:24:31,279
even when you use a variety of colors like this,

368
00:24:31,304 --> 00:24:32,935
when it comes to the balance,

369
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,763
I don't think it's going to be difficult.

370
00:24:34,896 --> 00:24:36,333
One thing to keep in mind is,

371
00:24:36,357 --> 00:24:38,363
if both colors have too high saturation,

372
00:24:38,388 --> 00:24:40,428
your eyes will get sore.

373
00:24:41,068 --> 00:24:43,349
Let's be careful not to do that.

374
00:24:50,771 --> 00:24:53,029
It's a way to put in snacks that the character likes.

375
00:25:06,541 --> 00:25:09,625
Let's say this illustration is like a second awakening in games.

376
00:25:09,907 --> 00:25:11,907
It's a cute character,

377
00:25:11,931 --> 00:25:13,194
but you want to emphasize it.

378
00:25:13,219 --> 00:25:14,899
When I try to express a cute character,

379
00:25:14,924 --> 00:25:16,267
it's better if it's small overall.

380
00:25:16,291 --> 00:25:17,204
That's what I said.

381
00:25:17,229 --> 00:25:18,760
It's not that I can't make them bigger at all.

382
00:25:18,785 --> 00:25:19,635
I can raise it.

383
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,730
If you maintain the silhouette,

384
00:25:21,755 --> 00:25:22,722
you can raise it.

385
00:25:22,941 --> 00:25:25,527
For example, if you add something,

386
00:25:26,761 --> 00:25:28,613
what other cute items are there?

387
00:25:29,199 --> 00:25:31,019
What comes to my mind right now is

388
00:25:36,143 --> 00:25:38,425
a European door

389
00:25:41,556 --> 00:25:43,152
that's made of wood.

390
00:26:08,762 --> 00:26:11,230
I want to give it a Christmas vibe.

391
00:26:14,479 --> 00:26:16,105
Even if it's not Christmas,

392
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:18,136
since there's a wizard setting to the character,

393
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,230
you can add that kind of setting.

394
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,347
Like a gift-giving wizard.

395
00:26:23,424 --> 00:26:25,543
Like a wizard who uses food magic.

396
00:26:27,189 --> 00:26:29,144
Or it's a bit cranky,

397
00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:32,004
so when the gift box opens, tentacles come out.

398
00:26:36,518 --> 00:26:39,113
You can add that kind of setting.

399
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:42,816
Of course, like that, cute characters

400
00:26:43,606 --> 00:26:45,918
or calm characters...

401
00:26:45,943 --> 00:26:47,600
In portrait illustration,

402
00:26:47,625 --> 00:26:49,625
the concept of the character itself

403
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:51,730
becomes very important.

404
00:26:52,112 --> 00:26:55,004
Compared to the full illustration, there are fewer elements around it.

405
00:26:55,029 --> 00:26:55,840
Anyhow,

406
00:26:56,184 --> 00:26:58,400
there are a lot of restrictions.

407
00:26:58,424 --> 00:27:00,978
It's about bringing out the charm of the character itself.

408
00:27:01,003 --> 00:27:03,146
The charm of the character itself

409
00:27:03,171 --> 00:27:04,695
becomes very important.

410
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,562
It's very important to make a charming setting.

411
00:27:07,587 --> 00:27:09,413
Making that attractive setting

412
00:27:09,585 --> 00:27:10,820
is up to you.

413
00:27:11,656 --> 00:27:13,101
What kind of setting is attractive?

414
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:14,767
Let's see what's attractive.

415
00:27:14,792 --> 00:27:16,624
It's based on preference.

416
00:27:16,781 --> 00:27:19,203
I'll keep detailing the preferences

417
00:27:19,851 --> 00:27:21,008
and refine it.

418
00:27:21,734 --> 00:27:23,320
It's important that your preferences are...

419
00:27:23,827 --> 00:27:26,118
I like everything.

420
00:27:26,143 --> 00:27:29,419
If you don't have any preferences and if you're picky,

421
00:27:29,443 --> 00:27:30,609
is there anything

422
00:27:30,742 --> 00:27:33,906
you like more among them?

423
00:27:34,187 --> 00:27:35,929
You need to keep getting to know yourself.

424
00:27:41,708 --> 00:27:44,585
When students come to my class,

425
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,140
especially the beginner classes,

426
00:27:46,224 --> 00:27:49,753
for those who are starting to work on the basics,

427
00:27:49,825 --> 00:27:52,242
I hope you have the time to get to know your hobby.

428
00:27:52,909 --> 00:27:54,707
I do give it as homework.

429
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:58,120
I encourage my students to find out about their hobbies.

430
00:27:58,706 --> 00:27:59,879
The reason why I do that is

431
00:27:59,903 --> 00:28:01,785
because those preferences

432
00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:03,200
become your motivation.

433
00:28:03,253 --> 00:28:04,800
And that motivation

434
00:28:04,902 --> 00:28:07,261
will help you find out

435
00:28:07,691 --> 00:28:10,222
how you should draw in the future.

436
00:28:14,597 --> 00:28:15,738
Let's put all that aside for now.

437
00:28:15,763 --> 00:28:18,167
I put a lot of things on the top.

438
00:28:18,346 --> 00:28:20,417
There were a lot of things up above.

439
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:23,267
Compared to a simple character design,

440
00:28:23,291 --> 00:28:26,613
to give a complex background...

441
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:28,233
The background is somewhat

442
00:28:28,257 --> 00:28:30,416
detailed if you look at it.

443
00:28:30,441 --> 00:28:33,050
It's about the distribution of density.

444
00:28:33,207 --> 00:28:34,964
The characters in the front and the background

445
00:28:34,989 --> 00:28:36,527
are separated.

446
00:28:36,996 --> 00:28:38,792
The background is detailed

447
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:40,817
and the character in the front is simple.

448
00:28:40,841 --> 00:28:42,033
I see this a lot everywhere.

449
00:28:42,057 --> 00:28:43,738
It's like that in animation.

450
00:28:44,645 --> 00:28:47,425
The characters only have two tones

451
00:28:47,449 --> 00:28:49,431
and the background is very detailed.

452
00:28:49,456 --> 00:28:51,105
Let's learn from the animation screen.

453
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:53,019
Make this similar.

454
00:28:53,043 --> 00:28:55,823
Make the particles as small as possible for the elements in the back.

455
00:28:56,384 --> 00:28:58,267
Decorate it in a cute way.

456
00:28:58,292 --> 00:29:00,738
The character in the front should be colored in simply.

457
00:29:00,762 --> 00:29:03,011
Depending on the situation,

458
00:29:03,036 --> 00:29:05,097
it's okay to take out the light and shadow more.

459
00:29:06,502 --> 00:29:09,822
The more things there are in the back, the more things fit in the background,

460
00:29:09,847 --> 00:29:12,230
the more the color of the characters will decrease.

461
00:29:14,605 --> 00:29:16,933
Simply put, there's no need to describe it.

462
00:29:22,573 --> 00:29:25,627
Description isn't really the point in these illustrations.

463
00:29:29,095 --> 00:29:30,003
Like this,

464
00:29:30,028 --> 00:29:32,431
I changed

465
00:29:32,456 --> 00:29:33,628
the first character to a cute vibe.

466
00:29:38,775 --> 00:29:39,558
This time,

467
00:29:39,583 --> 00:29:42,019
I'm going to change it to a calm vibe.

468
00:29:43,402 --> 00:29:45,331
Let's use the same sketch.

469
00:29:59,865 --> 00:30:02,825
To make it easier to see the difference, I'll place the right one too.

470
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,419
To make a calm character,

471
00:30:09,778 --> 00:30:12,317
I tried to make it look like an inverted triangle.

472
00:30:12,342 --> 00:30:13,888
Contrary to the first composition.

473
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:15,060
This one,

474
00:30:15,084 --> 00:30:17,357
you need to focus a lot on the lower part.

475
00:30:18,701 --> 00:30:21,193
And the character's tendencies

476
00:30:21,217 --> 00:30:22,107
or the posture

477
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:24,006
and the overall silhouette,

478
00:30:24,037 --> 00:30:25,576
they're going to sink a little bit.

479
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,536
You need it to feel that way.

480
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:30,529
Fortunately, the overall posture of the character...

481
00:30:30,554 --> 00:30:32,091
To give a calm vibe,

482
00:30:32,116 --> 00:30:34,076
it's not that bad.

483
00:30:34,176 --> 00:30:35,825
That's why I wanted to make this look special.

484
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:36,905
Let's do some more.

485
00:30:37,406 --> 00:30:39,427
First, the arm part that's up here,

486
00:30:48,293 --> 00:30:50,318
let's erase it.

487
00:30:52,287 --> 00:30:53,552
If you press the Delete button,

488
00:30:53,584 --> 00:30:55,139
you can erase the selected part.

489
00:31:05,402 --> 00:31:07,053
As much as you can play with the hair,

490
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:10,928
be calm with the silhouette.

491
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:15,716
The character's hair itself,

492
00:31:15,741 --> 00:31:18,194
since it's a silhouette that sticks out from the outside,

493
00:31:18,226 --> 00:31:20,944
it's not a good silhouette to give a calm look.

494
00:31:21,006 --> 00:31:22,804
What I learned from the previous silhouette...

495
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:23,834
So...

496
00:31:25,943 --> 00:31:28,053
For my character's personality, I have to give it to it.

497
00:31:28,388 --> 00:31:29,998
I'll express it to a certain extent,

498
00:31:30,108 --> 00:31:31,397
but as little as possible.

499
00:31:31,421 --> 00:31:33,436
I won't describe much here,

500
00:31:33,498 --> 00:31:35,881
so that you can't see it well.

501
00:31:35,906 --> 00:31:37,225
Let's hide it.

502
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:42,030
To make the expression look calm,

503
00:31:54,483 --> 00:31:55,928
I opened its eyes.

504
00:31:55,952 --> 00:31:57,390
It emptied the top and bottom of the eyes.

505
00:31:57,414 --> 00:31:59,000
Unlike the first configuration,

506
00:31:59,025 --> 00:32:01,014
in the second, open its eyes only halfway.

507
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:01,991
The eyes

508
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,780
should have a full eye socket.

509
00:32:28,584 --> 00:32:30,286
The silhouette of the hair, too,

510
00:32:30,311 --> 00:32:32,506
make it droop a little bit.

511
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:36,811
I'll apply it little by little.

512
00:32:36,836 --> 00:32:39,639
The uniformity is very important for these silhouettes.

513
00:32:39,997 --> 00:32:41,662
The silhouette that I had in mind at first...

514
00:32:41,687 --> 00:32:43,756
It's important to adjust it well until the end.

515
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:47,300
So if there are silhouettes that are the opposite,

516
00:32:47,325 --> 00:32:49,100
please take care of it.

517
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:50,068
In your own drawing,

518
00:32:50,209 --> 00:32:52,606
find the feeling that you want.

519
00:32:52,631 --> 00:32:54,412
I'm going to adjust the silhouette.

520
00:32:55,693 --> 00:32:57,842
If there are still drawings that you're working on,

521
00:32:57,867 --> 00:32:59,553
stop and look at the picture again.

522
00:33:00,222 --> 00:33:01,889
The silhouette that you want...

523
00:33:01,914 --> 00:33:03,936
See if everything fits in.

524
00:33:04,318 --> 00:33:07,030
I think it could be a bit sharper...

525
00:33:07,055 --> 00:33:08,999
I think it'd be okay if it's a little more round...

526
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:11,796
Is there anything that bothers you?

527
00:33:12,756 --> 00:33:14,811
Every time I grab them one by one...

528
00:33:14,836 --> 00:33:15,897
What are the character's tendencies?

529
00:33:15,921 --> 00:33:17,567
Depending on what you want,

530
00:33:17,592 --> 00:33:19,390
it's can be a more reinforced concept.

531
00:33:24,217 --> 00:33:25,623
The hat is droopy too.

532
00:33:27,007 --> 00:33:29,533
Unlike the top part where we opened the mouth,

533
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,616
close its mouth as much as possible.

534
00:33:34,014 --> 00:33:35,100
There's an element at the bottom.

535
00:33:35,125 --> 00:33:36,900
I think I need to add something.

536
00:33:36,924 --> 00:33:38,309
When I created a calm character,

537
00:33:38,334 --> 00:33:39,467
I drew water.

538
00:33:39,491 --> 00:33:41,366
You can use it as it is.

539
00:33:42,014 --> 00:33:44,053
You can draw water on the floor

540
00:33:48,498 --> 00:33:50,702
so that the characters look like they're reflected.

541
00:34:02,194 --> 00:34:03,335
Or

542
00:34:03,591 --> 00:34:04,928
this mint liquid

543
00:34:04,953 --> 00:34:06,639
can be a bit prevalent on the floor.

544
00:34:07,794 --> 00:34:09,684
Or the background,

545
00:34:09,709 --> 00:34:11,920
it's like the ruins of a building.

546
00:34:12,865 --> 00:34:14,218
Or use them all.

547
00:34:15,085 --> 00:34:17,530
You make it according to the scale that you want.

548
00:34:17,904 --> 00:34:19,405
I want something big.

549
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:20,553
This character is in its secondary awakening.

550
00:34:20,578 --> 00:34:22,498
If I say so, I'll continue to do so.

551
00:34:22,523 --> 00:34:24,155
This character needs to be patient

552
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,741
I'm going to draw the "Awakening" separately later.

553
00:34:25,766 --> 00:34:27,516
If that's the case, I'll add a little bit here.

554
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:30,802
Maintain a triangle shape until the end.

555
00:34:30,827 --> 00:34:32,447
Based on that,

556
00:34:33,869 --> 00:34:35,002
we'll continue to draw.

557
00:35:17,985 --> 00:35:20,618
As much as possible, I'll stretch out the bottom parts.

558
00:35:20,822 --> 00:35:22,900
Let's add a calm vibe.

559
00:35:32,062 --> 00:35:34,720
I think it'd be nice if the face was a bit droopy.

560
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,898
I'm lowering the head.

561
00:35:41,923 --> 00:35:43,611
It might look a bit more calm.

562
00:35:45,492 --> 00:35:47,822
If you spin it too much, it becomes dynamic.

563
00:35:47,847 --> 00:35:48,994
So I don't do that.

564
00:35:49,541 --> 00:35:51,100
The movement of the shoulders,

565
00:35:51,132 --> 00:35:53,041
make it relaxed.

566
00:35:53,066 --> 00:35:55,197
I'm touching it in as much detail as possible.

567
00:35:55,222 --> 00:35:56,494
There's not much to the details.

568
00:35:56,519 --> 00:35:58,484
I think it's better to pay attention to each of these things.

569
00:35:58,509 --> 00:35:59,400
It's detail.

570
00:36:28,096 --> 00:36:29,860
I used as many elements as possible

571
00:36:29,885 --> 00:36:31,462
as opposed to the former example.

572
00:36:31,487 --> 00:36:33,618
This time, the fewer elements the better.

573
00:36:36,758 --> 00:36:39,680
Items that have the same amount of information as characters.

574
00:36:39,735 --> 00:36:41,017
Let's take them out as much as possible

575
00:36:43,532 --> 00:36:45,305
and put in other information.

576
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:48,400
I think it's better to create a picture where you can focus on your character.

577
00:36:48,424 --> 00:36:50,329
When constructing a calm illustration,

578
00:36:50,354 --> 00:36:51,227
that's the point.

579
00:36:58,265 --> 00:37:00,477
It'd be nice to create some fog.

580
00:37:00,502 --> 00:37:02,822
Among the brushes,

581
00:37:02,923 --> 00:37:05,032
there are brushes that spread out.

582
00:37:10,273 --> 00:37:13,329
You can use these to add fog.

583
00:37:15,196 --> 00:37:16,757
Or you can Google it.

584
00:37:16,782 --> 00:37:19,860
If you search for fog texture and a fog brush,

585
00:37:19,885 --> 00:37:22,016
these days, it's really easy to find things like that.

586
00:37:25,904 --> 00:37:27,430
When you set the mood of the character,

587
00:37:27,455 --> 00:37:28,813
It'll be nice if you used them together.

588
00:37:35,069 --> 00:37:36,923
When I put glitter in it,

589
00:37:38,282 --> 00:37:40,345
I'm going to make it as small as possible.

590
00:37:42,876 --> 00:37:44,814
To make it look cute,

591
00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:47,634
unlike the ones that were big ones...

592
00:37:47,791 --> 00:37:50,783
So that it looks natural while getting a bit smaller.

593
00:37:51,509 --> 00:37:53,908
Let's make the flow of the glitter itself.

594
00:37:54,087 --> 00:37:55,859
Depending on how you place them,

595
00:37:55,884 --> 00:37:57,956
it can replace the feeling lines.

596
00:37:58,392 --> 00:37:59,173
So,

597
00:37:59,205 --> 00:38:01,361
it means that this can be a flow on its own.

598
00:38:16,975 --> 00:38:19,114
I'll have to color it now.

599
00:38:19,139 --> 00:38:21,785
In the character part,

600
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:23,098
according to the amount of information...

601
00:38:23,123 --> 00:38:25,239
Something simple with coloring...

602
00:38:25,817 --> 00:38:28,042
There aren't that many elements for the characters this time.

603
00:38:28,067 --> 00:38:30,182
The background doesn't have many elements.

604
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:31,778
Compared to the ones at the top.

605
00:38:31,779 --> 00:38:32,558
So,

606
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:34,968
I think it'll be okay if there's some shadow to it.

607
00:38:34,992 --> 00:38:36,778
Then, rather than the objects in the front,

608
00:38:36,803 --> 00:38:40,700
I'm saying that it'd be nice if the amount of light and shade could be increased.

609
00:38:40,724 --> 00:38:42,400
But if the contrast is big,

610
00:38:42,424 --> 00:38:45,215
the drawing itself comes to have a strong feeling, right?

611
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:47,512
It doesn't matter if you want to give it that feeling.

612
00:38:47,536 --> 00:38:49,051
If I wanted to

613
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:51,825
give a subtle feeling,

614
00:38:51,849 --> 00:38:53,824
I should make sure there isn't too much contrast.

615
00:38:53,849 --> 00:38:55,801
You need to be careful about it.

616
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,184
So, remember that.

617
00:38:59,208 --> 00:39:02,467
The bigger the contrast, the more intense the character is.

618
00:39:03,427 --> 00:39:04,881
When you want to make it calmer,

619
00:39:04,906 --> 00:39:07,092
let's also reduce the amount of contrast.

620
00:39:13,433 --> 00:39:16,444
I'll reduce the contrast and increase the amount of light and shade.

621
00:39:17,585 --> 00:39:19,936
I'll try to not apply it as much as possible.

622
00:39:20,147 --> 00:39:22,000
The sparkly feeling is

623
00:39:22,025 --> 00:39:24,500
a bit different from the calm vibe.

624
00:39:30,905 --> 00:39:31,756
Like this.

625
00:39:31,781 --> 00:39:34,850
To be honest, how do you use coloring?

626
00:39:35,163 --> 00:39:37,319
I want to know about coloring.

627
00:39:37,344 --> 00:39:39,061
How do you do coloring?

628
00:39:39,086 --> 00:39:40,631
There are things like that.

629
00:39:41,077 --> 00:39:44,380
Whether it's coloring or highlighting,

630
00:39:44,405 --> 00:39:46,125
whether it's a description or something like that,

631
00:39:46,795 --> 00:39:49,084
depending on the situation of the illustration,

632
00:39:49,109 --> 00:39:51,951
I think that's how it becomes more fluid.

633
00:39:53,694 --> 00:39:56,483
Let's see if your drawing needs highlights.

634
00:39:56,508 --> 00:39:58,686
You have to know that before you go in.

635
00:39:59,302 --> 00:40:01,707
But when coloring it, I always put the highlight here.

636
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,691
Adding highlights to the hair,

637
00:40:03,716 --> 00:40:05,624
this is my unique style.

638
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:07,311
You can do it like this.

639
00:40:07,763 --> 00:40:10,036
I might have to put it in like this.

640
00:40:10,061 --> 00:40:12,553
But I don't know if that's necessary for the illustration.

641
00:40:12,578 --> 00:40:13,811
Please think about it.

642
00:40:17,295 --> 00:40:19,168
Coloring changes very fluidly.

643
00:40:19,193 --> 00:40:21,149
Even if I don't try to put it in,

644
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,201
it feels like I'm using a brush.

645
00:40:23,225 --> 00:40:24,826
With each brush touch,

646
00:40:24,851 --> 00:40:26,834
your coloring methods will show up.

647
00:40:27,678 --> 00:40:30,865
If you've seen some illustrations,

648
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:32,076
whatever you draw,

649
00:40:32,101 --> 00:40:34,132
people recognize that you're the illustrator.

650
00:40:35,435 --> 00:40:37,037
That's how much

651
00:40:37,062 --> 00:40:39,796
your illustration is like a business card.

652
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,410
I think that's why it doesn't show our individuality.

653
00:40:42,435 --> 00:40:44,320
You don't have to worry.

654
00:40:44,905 --> 00:40:47,217
The painting that you're coloring right now,

655
00:40:48,537 --> 00:40:51,912
if you need the highlights, you can put it in.

656
00:40:51,998 --> 00:40:54,420
If you don't need it, you shouldn't put it in.

657
00:40:54,974 --> 00:40:57,318
That's the best way to balance it.

658
00:40:57,794 --> 00:40:58,592
Because

659
00:40:58,982 --> 00:41:02,115
you don't have to insist on coloring.

660
00:41:02,303 --> 00:41:03,725
The important thing is,

661
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:05,506
what's right for your drawing?

662
00:41:05,531 --> 00:41:07,850
The ability to think.

663
00:41:07,875 --> 00:41:09,529
I want to stress how important it is.

664
00:41:12,427 --> 00:41:13,900
To put it the other way around,

665
00:41:13,925 --> 00:41:15,810
it would be nice if I could use any coloring method.

666
00:41:15,835 --> 00:41:17,131
It's also about talking.

667
00:41:18,608 --> 00:41:20,436
I have to use it according to the situation.

668
00:41:20,461 --> 00:41:22,124
Let's increase our 'weapons'.

669
00:41:24,288 --> 00:41:26,819
I'm going to give lighting from the top.

670
00:41:27,795 --> 00:41:29,030
When you do things like this,

671
00:41:29,055 --> 00:41:31,538
if possible, it's better to draw a chart in your head

672
00:41:31,563 --> 00:41:32,741
before you proceed.

673
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,093
Express the tertiary colors as well.

674
00:41:44,155 --> 00:41:46,061
The top part of the tertiary colors...

675
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:48,500
If it goes into a red tone,

676
00:41:51,687 --> 00:41:52,975
the lower part is...

677
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,624
It'd be nice if it went in a more bluish color.

678
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:28,506
As you increase the amount of shadow...

679
00:42:32,767 --> 00:42:34,944
Increasing the amount of shadow

680
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:36,743
in this picture, the section that you can see with your eyes,

681
00:42:36,768 --> 00:42:38,337
it's also narrowing it.

682
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:41,329
People's eyes basically chase bright things.

683
00:42:41,581 --> 00:42:43,614
Lessening what people see,

684
00:42:43,639 --> 00:42:46,221
it means that people concentrate more on the character.

685
00:42:47,218 --> 00:42:48,903
There's nothing else to see.

686
00:42:48,979 --> 00:42:51,515
So you'd focus on the character.

687
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,583
Of course, as much as that,

688
00:42:52,608 --> 00:42:54,914
it'd be nice if you paid more attention to the character's description.

689
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:56,334
Compared to drawing a cute character,

690
00:43:00,048 --> 00:43:02,587
when you draw a calm character like this,

691
00:43:02,612 --> 00:43:04,323
you have to describe it a lot.

692
00:43:07,905 --> 00:43:09,218
Even if there's no highlight,

693
00:43:09,243 --> 00:43:11,791
I'm going to cut its hair into small pieces.

694
00:44:10,422 --> 00:44:12,521
I'll continue to

695
00:44:12,546 --> 00:44:14,899
add more, remove, and adjust the amount.

696
00:44:16,289 --> 00:44:17,206
Subtracting is

697
00:44:17,231 --> 00:44:19,404
harder than adding.

698
00:44:19,429 --> 00:44:21,700
It's important to be good at subtracting things.

699
00:44:22,209 --> 00:44:24,596
Think about whether something is really necessary.

700
00:44:24,621 --> 00:44:25,603
If you don't think so,

701
00:44:25,627 --> 00:44:27,037
take it out right away.

702
00:44:27,062 --> 00:44:28,993
It's important to make bold decisions.

703
00:44:30,295 --> 00:44:31,832
I'm saying it's important because

704
00:44:32,203 --> 00:44:33,707
most of the time, it's hard to do that.

705
00:44:34,109 --> 00:44:35,393
Because it took you so much time,

706
00:44:35,418 --> 00:44:37,224
you might not want to subtract it.

707
00:44:37,397 --> 00:44:39,519
It happens often when drawing.

708
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,884
You must have used your energy to draw that.

709
00:44:41,931 --> 00:44:43,078
You did your best.

710
00:44:43,102 --> 00:44:45,007
There are times when I wonder if I can just use it.

711
00:44:45,295 --> 00:44:46,200
When you take it out,

712
00:44:46,224 --> 00:44:47,815
I think it's better to leave it out.

713
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,300
It helps with illustrations.

714
00:44:52,134 --> 00:44:54,395
It's important to make good decisions.

715
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,813
Even when you add effects,

716
00:45:22,838 --> 00:45:23,818
in a calming way.

717
00:45:26,614 --> 00:45:27,508
Put it in.

718
00:45:43,315 --> 00:45:45,504
If you edit this part a bit,

719
00:45:59,209 --> 00:46:01,924
it will feel like the light is spreading out from the middle.

720
00:46:02,185 --> 00:46:04,053
It's like Soft Light.

721
00:46:04,078 --> 00:46:05,305
I'll do that, and,

722
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:10,490
in the middle where the light is strong,

723
00:46:10,515 --> 00:46:13,398
let's make sure that people are looking at it.

724
00:46:21,609 --> 00:46:23,513
If you compare before and after putting it in...

725
00:46:24,278 --> 00:46:25,043
Before,

726
00:46:25,097 --> 00:46:25,799
and after.

727
00:46:25,845 --> 00:46:28,707
You can definitely see that the viewer's eyes are tied to the middle

728
00:46:46,397 --> 00:46:47,399
like this.

729
00:46:47,641 --> 00:46:49,000
With a calm character,

730
00:46:49,025 --> 00:46:51,300
I drew cute characters.

731
00:46:51,506 --> 00:46:54,015
Let's adjust the top part.

732
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,518
It's a bit embarrassing to edit just the bottom part.

733
00:47:04,585 --> 00:47:06,033
This is the same.

734
00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:08,571
As I discussed with the previous full illustration,

735
00:47:08,596 --> 00:47:10,000
it has a Fade-Out effect.

736
00:47:10,024 --> 00:47:12,533
It's good to increase the concentration in the middle.

737
00:47:12,557 --> 00:47:14,810
But if you use Soft Light,

738
00:47:14,835 --> 00:47:16,700
there's already a lot of information in there.

739
00:47:16,724 --> 00:47:18,724
In that situation, if Soft Light is applied,

740
00:47:18,748 --> 00:47:19,573
from the perspective of the viewers,

741
00:47:19,598 --> 00:47:21,623
It could be too heavy.

742
00:47:21,656 --> 00:47:22,548
So that that doesn't happen,

743
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:24,906
you can make it

744
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:29,608
like this.

745
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:36,404
Even when I put light on it,

746
00:47:55,697 --> 00:47:57,211
this bright light,

747
00:47:57,751 --> 00:47:59,838
you can give apply it in a casual way.

748
00:48:08,197 --> 00:48:10,600
And it's good to have a lot of glitter items.

749
00:48:10,625 --> 00:48:12,267
With those,

750
00:48:12,291 --> 00:48:14,130
it'd be nice to use the background objects.

751
00:48:14,466 --> 00:48:15,903
Like a lantern.

752
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:19,957
There could be a lantern on the door,

753
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:27,620
or you can put a lantern on the floor.

754
00:48:39,297 --> 00:48:41,613
It could be holding a lantern with its tentacles.

755
00:48:42,446 --> 00:48:44,223
We can make a situation like that.

756
00:48:44,996 --> 00:48:47,723
I'll choose this tentacle

757
00:48:47,899 --> 00:48:49,186
and if it holds the sunglasses with this,

758
00:48:49,211 --> 00:48:50,391
that could be fun, too.

759
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:00,755
Putting in a funny situation

760
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:03,167
is a great way to create a cute character.

761
00:49:03,191 --> 00:49:05,495
So that it doesn't overpower the character,

762
00:49:05,533 --> 00:49:07,220
be careful when you apply it.

763
00:49:17,281 --> 00:49:18,867
Like this, today...

764
00:49:18,891 --> 00:49:20,110
This one character.

765
00:49:20,134 --> 00:49:21,894
Based on this character,

766
00:49:21,918 --> 00:49:23,235
we gave it a cute vibe

767
00:49:23,541 --> 00:49:24,915
and a calm vibe.

768
00:49:25,097 --> 00:49:26,596
We made up

769
00:49:26,621 --> 00:49:27,933
the mood of the illustration.

770
00:49:28,204 --> 00:49:30,310
If given the chance,

771
00:49:38,401 --> 00:49:41,319
I'd like to add a little more fog to this.

772
00:49:41,796 --> 00:49:43,309
I'll color it in roughly like this.

773
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:47,897
Let's make a hole.

774
00:49:48,015 --> 00:49:51,568
If you go to [Filter] - [Blur],

775
00:49:51,593 --> 00:49:52,833
there are various kinds of Blur effects.

776
00:49:52,857 --> 00:49:53,608
From among them,

777
00:49:53,633 --> 00:49:55,422
what I'm going to apply is Gaussian Blur.

778
00:49:55,813 --> 00:49:57,313
If you make it smudged like this,

779
00:49:57,338 --> 00:49:58,392
you can create

780
00:49:58,416 --> 00:49:59,798
quite a plausible fog.

781
00:50:04,131 --> 00:50:05,712
Based on the same character,

782
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:07,709
I created the mood.

783
00:50:07,733 --> 00:50:09,790
Compared to the previous full illustration,

784
00:50:09,815 --> 00:50:11,681
the way you use it is similar.

785
00:50:11,705 --> 00:50:14,116
So I made that up for today,

786
00:50:14,141 --> 00:50:15,316
like so.

787
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:17,079
When you create a cute character,

788
00:50:17,104 --> 00:50:18,489
add as many elements as you can.

789
00:50:18,514 --> 00:50:19,971
Close to the inverted triangular composition.

790
00:50:19,996 --> 00:50:21,690
Place a lot of elements on the top.

791
00:50:22,193 --> 00:50:23,533
And at the same time,

792
00:50:23,557 --> 00:50:25,576
put in a lot of highlights.

793
00:50:25,601 --> 00:50:27,349
It's important to use them

794
00:50:27,374 --> 00:50:29,114
to make it sparkly.

795
00:50:29,278 --> 00:50:30,867
As expected, with the full illustration,

796
00:50:30,891 --> 00:50:32,950
it's important to make a cute situation.

797
00:50:32,975 --> 00:50:34,283
Regarding the character's setting,

798
00:50:34,308 --> 00:50:36,104
you might need to adjust it little by little.

799
00:50:36,911 --> 00:50:38,415
In that case, do it boldly.

800
00:50:38,922 --> 00:50:41,182
And when you create a calm character, the opposite is true.

801
00:50:41,207 --> 00:50:43,160
Add just a little bit of the surrounding elements

802
00:50:43,185 --> 00:50:45,404
so that you can focus on the character.

803
00:50:45,526 --> 00:50:46,972
Don't make the viewers pay attention to the surrounding elements,

804
00:50:46,997 --> 00:50:48,806
so that they can focus on the character.

805
00:50:48,913 --> 00:50:51,262
Don't forget to

806
00:50:51,287 --> 00:50:52,182
maintain the triangular composition.

807
00:50:52,207 --> 00:50:54,767
Add as many elements as you can on the bottom,

808
00:50:54,805 --> 00:50:56,878
but make sure the character isn't overwhelmed.

809
00:50:56,903 --> 00:50:59,511
Controlling the amount is the key.

810
00:51:00,435 --> 00:51:01,252
And...

811
00:51:01,277 --> 00:51:02,867
To fit the atmosphere of the character,

812
00:51:02,891 --> 00:51:05,500
I'm going to use this kind of lighting.

813
00:51:05,524 --> 00:51:07,357
The part where the light is strong,

814
00:51:07,382 --> 00:51:09,933
the fact that you can focus more on it,

815
00:51:09,957 --> 00:51:12,385
we need to focus our attention on the character.

816
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:13,724
In the middle of the character,

817
00:51:13,749 --> 00:51:15,397
it's good if it has a strong impression.

818
00:51:15,422 --> 00:51:17,504
It means that it's good to focus on the lighting here.

819
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:19,528
Even those things

820
00:51:19,553 --> 00:51:20,999
need a little extra.

821
00:51:21,024 --> 00:51:23,424
I think you can make an illustration like this.

822
00:51:23,557 --> 00:51:24,483
Next time,

823
00:51:24,508 --> 00:51:25,847
with this one,

824
00:51:25,872 --> 00:51:28,000
we're going to make it look more aggressive.

825
00:51:28,024 --> 00:51:29,851
Then, I'm going to work on

826
00:51:29,876 --> 00:51:30,901
the one on the right.

827
00:51:31,006 --> 00:51:33,730
Since there's no color roughing process

828
00:51:33,755 --> 00:51:35,003
with our portrait illustration,

829
00:51:36,164 --> 00:51:36,995
next time,

830
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:39,200
we're going to do the color roughing for the character.

831
00:51:39,224 --> 00:51:40,463
Let's do the color roughing.

832
00:51:40,488 --> 00:51:43,022
I'm going to try colors that suit the mood.

833
00:51:43,209 --> 00:51:44,582
Let's also

834
00:51:44,607 --> 00:51:45,900
do the description.

835
00:51:46,298 --> 00:51:48,112
I think that's all for today.

836
00:51:48,114 --> 00:51:49,490
Thank you for your hard work.
