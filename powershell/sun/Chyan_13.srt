2
00:00:06,768 --> 00:00:07,830
Hello.

3
00:00:08,045 --> 00:00:09,279
From today,

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,243
by using a character we worked on with color roughs before,

5
00:00:12,254 --> 00:00:14,762
and applying many different moods,

6
00:00:14,787 --> 00:00:17,241
in this lecture, I'm going to recommend

7
00:00:17,243 --> 00:00:20,610
different types of directions for various moods.

8
00:00:21,514 --> 00:00:23,921
When we were talking about the previous illustration,

9
00:00:23,946 --> 00:00:26,910
the type of illustration that people like

10
00:00:27,883 --> 00:00:30,223
has a certain pattern,

11
00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:32,328
and by using that pattern,

12
00:00:32,353 --> 00:00:35,010
we could approach our illustration more easily.

13
00:00:36,018 --> 00:00:37,940
By using it,

14
00:00:37,965 --> 00:00:40,007
we're going to learn

15
00:00:40,121 --> 00:00:42,301
how to apply it.

16
00:00:42,898 --> 00:00:44,355
Within this curriculum,

17
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,019
this is something that I wanted to show students the most.

18
00:00:47,099 --> 00:00:48,250
In my class,

19
00:00:48,275 --> 00:00:51,122
I want to emphasize drawing as you intended

20
00:00:51,133 --> 00:00:53,089
the most

21
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,476
as I told you in the first lecture,

22
00:00:56,501 --> 00:00:59,126
and I hope you

23
00:00:59,151 --> 00:01:00,609
take it to heart.

24
00:01:00,795 --> 00:01:04,023
So let's work on it.

25
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:06,183
At first,

26
00:01:06,185 --> 00:01:09,425
we decided to make this character cute.

27
00:01:09,506 --> 00:01:12,723
Although there could be many interpretations of the cuteness,

28
00:01:12,748 --> 00:01:15,358
I'll interpret it

29
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,522
as a bright mood.

30
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:19,131
Because of the current design,

31
00:01:19,158 --> 00:01:21,705
the character's eyes look a bit scary

32
00:01:21,842 --> 00:01:23,759
and it looks a bit serious.

33
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:27,045
So I'm going to make this character in a different mood.

34
00:01:27,548 --> 00:01:29,288
Just in case, I need to back it up.

35
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,898
For future comparisons,

36
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:48,098
let's work on layers that you can see,

37
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:54,219
to see the difference.

38
00:01:54,244 --> 00:01:57,575
I'm going to draw a cute illustration.

39
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,308
To express a cute illustration,

40
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:00,595
Which part do you think is important?

41
00:02:00,992 --> 00:02:02,060
It doesn't apply to all of them,

42
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,174
but

43
00:02:03,199 --> 00:02:06,318
if it's a cute illustration,

44
00:02:14,688 --> 00:02:16,707
warm colors are often used.

45
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:19,266
Warm colors,

46
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:22,016
such as, yellow and red,

47
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,288
it's going to be these kinds of colors.

48
00:02:23,313 --> 00:02:26,409
Some of the green ones are also warm colors.

49
00:02:26,434 --> 00:02:30,381
There are many cases where warm colors are used like that.

50
00:02:30,521 --> 00:02:33,120
And overall, a baby-like tone is used a lot.

51
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:39,095
You can call it a milky tone,

52
00:02:39,106 --> 00:02:40,913
mixed with white.

53
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:44,079
You can give it a high contrast, but,

54
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,499
usually for these types

55
00:02:46,057 --> 00:02:48,379
we tend to use

56
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,413
colors with a softer tone.

57
00:02:50,102 --> 00:02:51,721
The overall contrast is

58
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:55,403
not that strong.

59
00:02:55,893 --> 00:02:58,337
If it's too strong, the drawing will be too intense.

60
00:02:58,362 --> 00:03:02,207
So if you wanted to create a cute and warm atmosphere,

61
00:03:02,232 --> 00:03:06,264
it's good to break away from high contrast illustration.

62
00:03:07,013 --> 00:03:10,114
Especially some people use the reds,

63
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:12,621
and brighter colors sometimes.

64
00:03:12,713 --> 00:03:15,310
The skin turns really red.

65
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:16,327
In that case,

66
00:03:16,338 --> 00:03:19,141
although the first thing you wanted to do was to have a warm atmosphere,

67
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,415
after doing it, the overall mood of the illustration looks really strong,

68
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:23,802
like it's blazing.

69
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:26,709
For those who feel it is like that,

70
00:03:27,566 --> 00:03:29,610
there must have been some mistakes in the setting,

71
00:03:29,635 --> 00:03:32,514
like the contrast between the saturation.

72
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,299
So it is important

73
00:03:34,331 --> 00:03:35,897
to prevent things like that.

74
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,140
Let's move on.

75
00:03:41,302 --> 00:03:44,303
I'll add some eye glow to make it look cute.

76
00:03:45,596 --> 00:03:47,409
It's not an eye glow, but a highlight.

77
00:03:54,998 --> 00:03:59,626
I'm going to paste all the colors I've used before,

78
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:04,876
to change the color first.

79
00:04:04,887 --> 00:04:08,177
By using Ctrl+B, the Color Range Tool,

80
00:04:08,179 --> 00:04:10,828
I'm going to add a reddish color.

81
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:23,038
And I'll select the areas that receive light with the Magic Wand Tool.

82
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:27,600
I'm going to make the light part brighter.

83
00:04:34,392 --> 00:04:37,104
Use the tool [Select] - [Color range]

84
00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:39,149
to choose the range you want.

85
00:04:44,972 --> 00:04:48,323
Press the Shift key and select the range you want

86
00:04:57,201 --> 00:05:00,055
and I'll raise the saturation a bit.

87
00:05:03,384 --> 00:05:05,849
If you increase the saturation too much, as I said before,

88
00:05:05,859 --> 00:05:07,103
it can make the impression too strong.

89
00:05:07,128 --> 00:05:08,307
So, to avoid that,

90
00:05:13,341 --> 00:05:15,500
I'm going to make a gradation.

91
00:05:21,746 --> 00:05:24,094
You can turn on your Pen Pressure from now on.

92
00:05:24,105 --> 00:05:26,026
When you edit your drawing,

93
00:05:26,028 --> 00:05:28,541
at that stage, you can turn on the Pen Pressure.

94
00:05:28,566 --> 00:05:29,958
The reason why I turned it off before is because,

95
00:05:29,969 --> 00:05:32,362
if you can't control your Pen Pressure,

96
00:05:33,086 --> 00:05:35,554
if you press these buttons at the top,

97
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:37,200
you can turn it on and off.

98
00:05:37,225 --> 00:05:39,495
But, if this is your first time with a drawing tablet,

99
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,397
or if you're not used to using one,

100
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,298
I think it's better to turn off the pressure.

101
00:05:44,323 --> 00:05:45,856
It's much more helpful for later work.

102
00:05:45,996 --> 00:05:48,102
So in the beginning,

103
00:05:48,104 --> 00:05:50,219
I recommend that you turn off your Pen Pressure.

104
00:05:51,223 --> 00:05:52,409
And there's that, too.

105
00:05:52,434 --> 00:05:54,753
When you work on colors,

106
00:05:54,778 --> 00:05:57,044
you might make some colors a bit vague.

107
00:05:57,137 --> 00:05:58,496
Even with the parts that you don't know well,

108
00:05:58,521 --> 00:06:00,924
you might be able to color them in with Pen Pressure turned on.

109
00:06:01,432 --> 00:06:06,310
So, I recommend you turn off your Pen Pressure

110
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:09,409
so that you won't rely on luck.

111
00:06:09,613 --> 00:06:12,221
But you'll only do that in the beginning.

112
00:06:12,362 --> 00:06:14,082
If you're a bit past the beginning,

113
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,380
from then on, you can use the coloring method

114
00:06:16,534 --> 00:06:18,633
that you want.

115
00:06:19,215 --> 00:06:20,930
When I teach students,

116
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,734
I don't recommend

117
00:06:22,736 --> 00:06:24,369
a certain coloring method to them.

118
00:06:24,705 --> 00:06:27,188
I think it's good to change the background a bit.

119
00:06:27,213 --> 00:06:29,512
I'll make the background color

120
00:06:33,695 --> 00:06:34,948
into a mild color.

121
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,821
I'll make it a little darker.

122
00:06:45,134 --> 00:06:47,785
I'm going to use gradation here

123
00:06:53,798 --> 00:06:55,205
to make it a bit softer.

124
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:01,115
Let's spread it out.

125
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,873
I'm going to edit it as well.

126
00:07:03,884 --> 00:07:06,687
I'm going to make a layer on top of the outline layer.

127
00:07:06,712 --> 00:07:07,985
Let's get started.

128
00:07:08,974 --> 00:07:11,313
As I said before, due to the character design,

129
00:07:11,324 --> 00:07:12,578
it looks a bit

130
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:14,594
scary, don't you think?

131
00:07:14,605 --> 00:07:16,743
So that we can cover up those parts,

132
00:07:16,753 --> 00:07:20,009
I'm going to modify the drawing composition bit by bit.

133
00:07:20,104 --> 00:07:21,481
The first thing I need to fix is

134
00:07:21,506 --> 00:07:22,617
this hand.

135
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,325
In terms of the overall flow of perspective,

136
00:07:24,336 --> 00:07:26,811
this hand could be one of the elements

137
00:07:26,836 --> 00:07:29,505
that could be a sub element

138
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:30,590
to the gaze that goes downwards from the face.

139
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,616
You can see the hands after the face.

140
00:07:32,715 --> 00:07:36,113
But when we have the main and sub elements together,

141
00:07:36,138 --> 00:07:38,630
there's a difference between

142
00:07:38,987 --> 00:07:40,473
when you put them close together

143
00:07:40,498 --> 00:07:42,728
and when you place them far apart.

144
00:07:42,841 --> 00:07:44,383
If you place them far apart,

145
00:07:44,408 --> 00:07:47,523
it's easy to give a calm impression.

146
00:07:47,589 --> 00:07:50,853
On the other hand, the closer you put this on the character's face,

147
00:07:50,878 --> 00:07:53,311
it makes the character look a bit cuter.

148
00:07:53,313 --> 00:07:57,400
When you want to make a strong impression, it will help you a lot.

149
00:08:07,405 --> 00:08:08,785
Like this.

150
00:08:37,501 --> 00:08:41,025
Pull the hand up and bring it closer to the face.

151
00:08:41,295 --> 00:08:43,654
Put this hand to the side a little bit more.

152
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,545
Since it looks calm right now,

153
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,909
I'll try to make it look even more calm.

154
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,466
I'll change it to a powerful posture.

155
00:08:52,023 --> 00:08:54,978
I think it's better to have a strong posture

156
00:08:55,003 --> 00:08:56,153
so that the character looks

157
00:08:56,164 --> 00:08:57,824
more energetic.

158
00:08:58,275 --> 00:09:01,705
If it doesn't have a strong posture, it could look calm and mature.

159
00:09:04,082 --> 00:09:05,972
When you give it this kind of feeling,

160
00:09:05,997 --> 00:09:10,539
when you choose between two things,

161
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,600
it will be very easy to work on it.

162
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:17,312
For example, if you move the arms far away,

163
00:09:17,337 --> 00:09:19,375
which one is cuter, closer or farther?

164
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,020
That's what you would ask yourself.

165
00:09:31,985 --> 00:09:34,463
I'm going to finish this section here.

166
00:09:42,274 --> 00:09:45,091
I'll make the light a little stronger.

167
00:09:47,468 --> 00:09:48,812
I'll strengthen the contrast a little bit.

168
00:09:50,021 --> 00:09:53,014
If it's too bright, like I said before, it's going to be intense.

169
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,998
So, you should avoid that.

170
00:09:55,023 --> 00:09:57,102
But I'll strengthen it

171
00:09:57,112 --> 00:09:58,145
until the illustration looks clear.

172
00:09:59,109 --> 00:10:01,586
Instead, you can widen the area of the light

173
00:10:01,611 --> 00:10:03,815
and brighten up the overall illustration,

174
00:10:04,661 --> 00:10:08,007
it will fit the bright image that we want to create.

175
00:10:12,004 --> 00:10:14,001
If you compare it to the beginning,

176
00:10:14,292 --> 00:10:17,222
you can see that the feeling changes to a certain extent.

177
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:28,983
Especially in this cute image,

178
00:10:29,008 --> 00:10:32,586
the overall visibility needs to stand out.

179
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,894
So, it should be easy to see the picture at a glance.

180
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:37,589
A cute first impression

181
00:10:37,614 --> 00:10:39,709
is part of your intuition.

182
00:10:39,788 --> 00:10:44,325
While we usually enjoy sentimental things slowly,

183
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,782
being cute is kind of like

184
00:10:45,807 --> 00:10:47,997
the refreshing first bite

185
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,439
when you taste something.

186
00:10:52,094 --> 00:10:53,114
How can I compare them?

187
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:57,533
It's the difference between fine dining food and fruit.

188
00:10:57,788 --> 00:11:00,101
It's refreshing when you eat fruit in one bite.

189
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,687
Isn't it?

190
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:03,285
If it doesn't feel like that,

191
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:05,906
we don't usually eat that fruit.

192
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:09,017
So, it's important to give that sort of feeling

193
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:11,291
when you're going for a cute illustration.

194
00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:17,503
Put freshness into the picture.

195
00:11:18,704 --> 00:11:20,522
If I have to express it, it's kind of like that.

196
00:11:26,985 --> 00:11:28,610
I'm going to create shadows.

197
00:11:36,892 --> 00:11:39,207
It'd be nice to make the character blush, too.

198
00:11:43,477 --> 00:11:46,210
It used to be a character with very pale skin color,

199
00:11:46,794 --> 00:11:48,440
but let's strengthen the areas

200
00:11:48,593 --> 00:11:50,453
that could look a bit cute.

201
00:11:50,463 --> 00:11:51,541
Like this.

202
00:12:02,194 --> 00:12:05,118
But if you do it too much, it'll stand out.

203
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:07,297
So, strengthen it just a little bit.

204
00:12:08,304 --> 00:12:10,141
So, to make the eyes look clear,

205
00:12:10,152 --> 00:12:11,985
I'll make the pupils bigger.

206
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:19,050
Let's add one more thing.

207
00:12:19,075 --> 00:12:21,264
Now, with bright illustrations,

208
00:12:21,266 --> 00:12:23,832
it'd be nice if it had a sparkly vibe.

209
00:12:23,975 --> 00:12:26,217
But to make it sparkly,

210
00:12:26,228 --> 00:12:29,253
the basic drawing needs to be a bit dark.

211
00:12:31,099 --> 00:12:32,192
What I'm saying is,

212
00:12:32,203 --> 00:12:34,142
if it's too bright,

213
00:12:34,144 --> 00:12:36,508
it will be just a white illustration.

214
00:12:36,533 --> 00:12:38,366
It won't be a sparkly illustration.

215
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:40,794
When do we use

216
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,482
the expression 'sparkly'?

217
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:44,777
You use it when you look at the stars in the night sky.

218
00:12:45,018 --> 00:12:46,064
The stars.

219
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:47,308
The night sky is dark, right?

220
00:12:48,631 --> 00:12:51,226
Because the stars shine brightly, we look at it

221
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:53,697
and say that it's sparkling.

222
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:56,810
Because of that,

223
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,112
if you want to make the character to be more sparkly,

224
00:13:00,137 --> 00:13:03,731
there need to be dark areas.

225
00:13:03,818 --> 00:13:06,264
There are many people who misinterpret this part.

226
00:13:06,289 --> 00:13:09,684
Say you want to draw a cute and bright character,

227
00:13:09,695 --> 00:13:13,300
but it doesn't have that sparkly look when you draw it.

228
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:18,050
There are a lot of shining parts and it's flashy,

229
00:13:18,061 --> 00:13:20,658
but you can't feel that.

230
00:13:20,683 --> 00:13:22,586
Most people who think that

231
00:13:22,596 --> 00:13:24,799
don't really use dark parts in their drawings.

232
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,331
You have to think the other way around.

233
00:13:27,405 --> 00:13:29,231
To make a drawing look cute,

234
00:13:29,256 --> 00:13:32,315
it may be that the darker parts need to be increased.

235
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:38,090
Because of that, with even the hair parts,

236
00:13:38,115 --> 00:13:40,297
I'm making some dark areas.

237
00:13:40,503 --> 00:13:42,238
Since I made it dark,

238
00:13:42,263 --> 00:13:44,513
remember the character's hair was white before, right?

239
00:13:44,538 --> 00:13:47,219
White hair can't be highlighted.

240
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,677
They're all white, but even if I use white here,

241
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:51,720
it won't really be emphasized.

242
00:13:51,953 --> 00:13:54,504
But by shadowing some specific part like this,

243
00:13:59,907 --> 00:14:02,169
if you apply a color close to white,

244
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,227
in the middle section, like this,

245
00:14:06,603 --> 00:14:10,105
this part shines as bright as the highlight.

246
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:12,724
So if you look at the before and after of the illustration...

247
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,097
Before.

248
00:14:14,108 --> 00:14:15,133
After.

249
00:14:15,143 --> 00:14:17,660
You'll be able to see

250
00:14:17,671 --> 00:14:18,756
the hair shines bright like this.

251
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:22,104
That's how you use the highlights.

252
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:23,149
It's important.

253
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:25,674
It needs to be dark to use highlights.

254
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,915
That's must-have knowledge.

255
00:14:34,294 --> 00:14:37,658
With the feeling that the shadow on this side is a bit more vivid,

256
00:14:37,683 --> 00:14:40,304
although the shadow of the head wouldn't look like this,

257
00:14:40,321 --> 00:14:43,122
matching with the shadow on the bottom of the neck,

258
00:14:44,423 --> 00:14:46,178
to make the direction of the shadow more visible,

259
00:14:46,189 --> 00:14:48,604
from the viewers' perspective,

260
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:49,641
I'll designate it.

261
00:14:50,885 --> 00:14:53,575
As I said before, visibility matters.

262
00:14:55,182 --> 00:14:58,410
Be careful not to add too much shadow.

263
00:15:04,283 --> 00:15:06,014
And make the illustration clear.

264
00:15:12,901 --> 00:15:15,115
Would it be cute to have more creases?

265
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,827
Or would it be cute if there were fewer creases?

266
00:15:17,988 --> 00:15:20,016
It's easy to answer.

267
00:15:20,477 --> 00:15:23,494
When I ask you regarding this nuance,

268
00:15:23,698 --> 00:15:27,225
9 out of 10 people come up with similar answers.

269
00:15:28,144 --> 00:15:29,707
Most of the cute clothes,

270
00:15:29,718 --> 00:15:31,280
like zip-up hoodies, etc.,

271
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:33,761
they don't have creases that much.

272
00:15:34,385 --> 00:15:36,255
Usually, dresses

273
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,547
or luxurious dresses,

274
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:41,119
those kinds of clothes often get creases.

275
00:15:41,612 --> 00:15:44,973
Since we're drawing a cute character,

276
00:15:44,998 --> 00:15:47,213
in the current situation where you draw a cute character,

277
00:15:47,387 --> 00:15:49,694
creases on clothes and the texture of hair,

278
00:15:49,719 --> 00:15:52,223
it's important not to break it into small pieces.

279
00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:56,419
"Is it cute when the colors are colorful?"

280
00:15:56,444 --> 00:15:58,819
"Or is it cute to have one color?"

281
00:15:59,887 --> 00:16:02,566
It's cute to use various colors,

282
00:16:02,591 --> 00:16:04,668
although it could be a bit childish,

283
00:16:04,693 --> 00:16:05,721
it will look pretty.

284
00:16:05,955 --> 00:16:08,567
I'm going to go into more detail in the description stage,

285
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:11,018
but at this point,

286
00:16:11,043 --> 00:16:12,846
between the boundary of the light-free zone

287
00:16:12,857 --> 00:16:14,971
and the part where the light comes in, you can divide into two parts.

288
00:16:14,973 --> 00:16:17,815
The boundary of the Cast Shadow we learned before,

289
00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:20,391
and the boundary of the highlight.

290
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,613
It's called the boundary color.

291
00:16:22,638 --> 00:16:25,118
You can have a high saturation line here.

292
00:16:26,397 --> 00:16:27,404
Like this.

293
00:16:27,597 --> 00:16:30,720
The thing you need to care about

294
00:16:31,285 --> 00:16:33,166
when you look at this in black and white,

295
00:16:33,191 --> 00:16:34,855
when you look at the illustration in black and white,

296
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:40,880
I think it's better to go in between bright and dark tones.

297
00:16:40,905 --> 00:16:42,000
I think it's the best.

298
00:16:42,524 --> 00:16:46,396
Let's say I put a high saturation line here.

299
00:16:46,421 --> 00:16:49,637
And if this one stands out more than the color below,

300
00:16:49,648 --> 00:16:50,655
and if it gets dark,

301
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,896
it stands out from a distance.

302
00:16:53,374 --> 00:16:56,338
It doesn't matter if you want to make it stand out,

303
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:57,374
but if it's not,

304
00:16:57,385 --> 00:17:00,118
and if you want to make it look natural,

305
00:17:00,129 --> 00:17:01,764
in that case, be careful when you adjust the color.

306
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:04,075
so that it doesn't get darker

307
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,421
than the dark parts.

308
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:10,806
How could I turn it into black and white?

309
00:17:10,831 --> 00:17:12,782
For those who use Clip Studio Paint,

310
00:17:12,792 --> 00:17:13,797
just in case,

311
00:17:13,822 --> 00:17:16,318
I'll show you how to use it.

312
00:17:18,114 --> 00:17:19,747
Make a layer on the top,

313
00:17:19,758 --> 00:17:21,103
and cover it with white.

314
00:17:21,283 --> 00:17:23,612
And set the properties of this layer

315
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:27,617
to anything below such as hue, saturation, etc.

316
00:17:27,618 --> 00:17:30,614
Then every time you turn it off and on, the illustration changes to black and white.

317
00:17:30,767 --> 00:17:32,504
You can look at it like that.

318
00:17:33,004 --> 00:17:34,828
For those who use Photoshop,

319
00:17:34,908 --> 00:17:36,907
If you press Ctrl+Y,

320
00:17:36,917 --> 00:17:39,185
there's probably a tool that lets you see in CMYK.

321
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:40,222
Press it now.

322
00:17:40,247 --> 00:17:41,585
Press Ctrl+Y.

323
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:43,107
Now, on the upper left

324
00:17:43,109 --> 00:17:46,235
you'll see the word CMYK.

325
00:17:46,246 --> 00:17:47,600
I'm going to use that concept.

326
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:57,226
There is [View] - [Proof Setup] - [Custom].

327
00:17:57,305 --> 00:17:58,425
If you go in here,

328
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,570
There's a device down here to simulate your preferences.

329
00:18:00,572 --> 00:18:02,527
It will be set to CMYK.

330
00:18:02,552 --> 00:18:05,058
If you click it and scroll down,

331
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,014
you can set it to 'sGray'.

332
00:18:07,228 --> 00:18:08,729
Then, press the OK button.

333
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,575
If you do that, whenever you press Ctrl+Y,

334
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,901
you'll be able to see the illustration turn black and white.

335
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,251
It's quite convenient.

336
00:18:17,276 --> 00:18:20,106
There are times when the black and white tone is different

337
00:18:20,108 --> 00:18:22,072
from what you've illustrated so far.

338
00:18:22,097 --> 00:18:24,488
It prevents such problems.

339
00:18:25,398 --> 00:18:29,418
So, check in black and white as often as possible.

340
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:30,814
I'd recommend that, too.

341
00:18:34,602 --> 00:18:36,280
The reason why this section is especially difficult is

342
00:18:36,305 --> 00:18:38,696
because of the unique brightness of each color,

343
00:18:39,195 --> 00:18:42,715
the colors we use are often set to different tones.

344
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:58,113
I'll add highlights like this

345
00:19:02,195 --> 00:19:03,698
to set the mood for the painting.

346
00:19:04,065 --> 00:19:07,433
Let's stop here and compare the before and after.

347
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,707
You can see it's gotten a lot brighter.

348
00:19:12,802 --> 00:19:14,219
What else can I do?

349
00:19:14,244 --> 00:19:17,635
I'll make the highlights sparkle,

350
00:19:17,675 --> 00:19:21,010
Or you can add cute elements.

351
00:19:22,499 --> 00:19:23,502
Something like this.

352
00:19:26,909 --> 00:19:28,537
The tentacled creature here

353
00:19:28,548 --> 00:19:30,310
doesn't look so cute.

354
00:19:38,506 --> 00:19:43,778
But, the setting where the creature is sitting on the

355
00:19:44,723 --> 00:19:46,703
female character's lap is cute.

356
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:48,628
You can use that setting.

357
00:19:50,419 --> 00:19:51,461
It's like that.

358
00:19:51,471 --> 00:19:54,609
It's kind of like a girl with a dog that looks cute.

359
00:20:05,108 --> 00:20:06,925
Like this.

360
00:20:14,221 --> 00:20:16,152
I didn't make it look that cute,

361
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,040
but it depends on how you express it.

362
00:20:28,692 --> 00:20:31,366
So, just like this, the creature over here

363
00:20:31,368 --> 00:20:33,211
could be eating cake.

364
00:20:33,409 --> 00:20:35,648
It's good to use many cute props.

365
00:20:35,673 --> 00:20:37,980
You'll use dot elements at this stage.

366
00:20:38,005 --> 00:20:40,466
When you want to draw a cute character,

367
00:20:40,467 --> 00:20:43,973
it's good to have all those elements around it.

368
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:45,374
As I said before,

369
00:20:45,399 --> 00:20:46,818
to make a cute impression,

370
00:20:46,843 --> 00:20:49,584
it's important to give a strong first impression.

371
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:51,800
To make a strong first impression,

372
00:20:51,825 --> 00:20:54,638
it's good to use various objects around the character

373
00:20:54,663 --> 00:20:56,080
to make the picture look full.

374
00:20:56,105 --> 00:20:58,270
It will be very good.

375
00:20:58,295 --> 00:21:00,431
So, if you look at cute illustrations,

376
00:21:00,456 --> 00:21:02,740
you can see a lot of elements like food.

377
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,508
Food is used often,

378
00:21:05,846 --> 00:21:07,457
and especially desserts.

379
00:21:07,482 --> 00:21:10,165
Starting with that, I could use animals

380
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,695
or add a lot of elements to the background.

381
00:21:12,995 --> 00:21:14,306
That happens often.

382
00:21:14,415 --> 00:21:17,884
Because of that, we need to use those kinds of things

383
00:21:18,105 --> 00:21:20,672
to make the illustration

384
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:21,987
look cute.

385
00:21:22,012 --> 00:21:23,931
Let's make it eat cake.

386
00:21:24,276 --> 00:21:27,313
It looks disgusting, but it might like cake.

387
00:21:34,385 --> 00:21:36,056
Let's draw it

388
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:54,565
like this.

389
00:21:56,158 --> 00:21:58,526
I'll continue to increase the highlights.

390
00:22:04,345 --> 00:22:05,529
The color of highlights shouldn't

391
00:22:05,531 --> 00:22:07,337
be too different from that of the character.

392
00:22:07,362 --> 00:22:09,627
So, I'll maintain a blueish color.

393
00:22:09,814 --> 00:22:12,691
If it's too yellow or red all of a sudden,

394
00:22:12,693 --> 00:22:14,528
the viewers would be confused.

395
00:22:14,915 --> 00:22:18,372
If it's a color where yellow is mixed with the blue,

396
00:22:18,397 --> 00:22:19,762
it would be green.

397
00:22:19,816 --> 00:22:22,220
Let's put it in like that.

398
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:33,526
The best thing to do when drawing cute illustrations is

399
00:22:33,528 --> 00:22:35,123
putting the character in a cute situation.

400
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,374
It's best for this character to act cute.

401
00:22:39,392 --> 00:22:42,633
So, right now, I'm using colors to demonstrate.

402
00:22:42,677 --> 00:22:45,317
Although I'm editing the form to a certain extent.

403
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:47,770
So, now it looks like this.

404
00:22:47,795 --> 00:22:50,915
When you want to draw a cute image,

405
00:22:50,926 --> 00:22:54,941
I always advise students to think about the situation

406
00:22:55,087 --> 00:22:56,407
before they draw.

407
00:23:00,893 --> 00:23:03,229
Make the background light strong, too.

408
00:23:04,705 --> 00:23:06,468
You should check

409
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,128
whether or not the overall contrast is too strong.

410
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:10,036
Except for the black part

411
00:23:10,061 --> 00:23:11,567
it's not too chaotic.

412
00:23:22,307 --> 00:23:24,589
If the illustration simply has a higher contrast,

413
00:23:24,749 --> 00:23:25,982
as I said before,

414
00:23:26,007 --> 00:23:27,990
the strong impression will become too strong.

415
00:23:28,015 --> 00:23:30,712
So, it's hard for the viewers

416
00:23:30,889 --> 00:23:32,116
to perceive it as being cute.

417
00:23:33,976 --> 00:23:34,994
So,

418
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:36,706
it becomes like this.

419
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:39,023
But, it's hard to think that this is cute.

420
00:23:39,496 --> 00:23:41,333
So, I made the contrast like this.

421
00:23:41,358 --> 00:23:43,277
It's not too strong.

422
00:23:43,302 --> 00:23:44,707
But it is still there.

423
00:23:44,732 --> 00:23:48,196
It's important to keep the overall tone milky.

424
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:11,785
I'm going to add more tertiary colors.

425
00:24:12,105 --> 00:24:15,113
Now that we're done with this, let's use the Editing tool.

426
00:24:15,145 --> 00:24:18,470
If you used a normal Brush until now,

427
00:24:18,488 --> 00:24:20,188
now let's use this tool.

428
00:24:20,985 --> 00:24:23,435
Before that, I'll decrease the black area.

429
00:24:23,694 --> 00:24:25,243
There are so many black areas.

430
00:24:25,268 --> 00:24:27,711
The cracks don't make the character look cute, either.

431
00:24:28,495 --> 00:24:29,815
So, we should get rid of them.

432
00:24:33,174 --> 00:24:36,118
I'll erase them now.

433
00:24:40,809 --> 00:24:44,244
Now, onto the editing stage.

434
00:24:44,269 --> 00:24:45,330
I'll create one Layer.

435
00:24:45,355 --> 00:24:47,418
Normally, when I go into editing,

436
00:24:47,443 --> 00:24:49,105
I use the Overlay function often.

437
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,796
I use the Multiply function often, too.

438
00:24:51,202 --> 00:24:53,039
We learned a little about layers before, right?

439
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:56,826
Overlay gives light to the color on top.

440
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,816
So, the saturation will be stronger.

441
00:24:58,818 --> 00:25:01,492
You can say that the illustration will get 'burnt'.

442
00:25:02,721 --> 00:25:03,826
What should I do?

443
00:25:03,828 --> 00:25:05,538
I'm going to use the orangeish colors.

444
00:25:10,312 --> 00:25:15,481
Specifically, I will use orangeish and reddish colors with low saturation.

445
00:25:15,506 --> 00:25:19,194
Make sure that the upper right part is brightened due to the light.

446
00:25:20,733 --> 00:25:22,495
I'm going to make sure of it.

447
00:25:24,501 --> 00:25:27,616
I will make these turquoise areas

448
00:25:27,705 --> 00:25:29,604
to look shiny

449
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:31,928
like this.

450
00:25:32,712 --> 00:25:34,934
Let's give it a shining effect.

451
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:40,308
I'm going to make it so that it doesn't become too bright.

452
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:43,782
After applying it like this, I'll adjust the opacity.

453
00:25:44,593 --> 00:25:46,925
I'll stop when I want to.

454
00:26:00,106 --> 00:26:01,626
Before, and after.

455
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:03,744
The impression has changed quite a lot.

456
00:26:04,705 --> 00:26:06,794
When you make a cute image like this,

457
00:26:06,796 --> 00:26:08,740
make sure the overall contrast

458
00:26:08,742 --> 00:26:11,393
doesn't get too big.

459
00:26:11,418 --> 00:26:13,820
Make sure it looks milky

460
00:26:14,213 --> 00:26:17,103
while adding a sparkly feel to it.

461
00:26:17,296 --> 00:26:19,789
It's important to adjust the canvas this way.

462
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,432
Since we need to have more shiny items,

463
00:26:22,457 --> 00:26:24,523
the highlight needs to go in here and there.

464
00:26:26,105 --> 00:26:30,187
And at the same time, we have to place the main element and the sub element closer to each other.

465
00:26:30,198 --> 00:26:32,403
Place as many things as you can.

466
00:26:32,428 --> 00:26:33,938
You can add more than this.

467
00:26:35,506 --> 00:26:36,640
You could add a fork,

468
00:26:37,706 --> 00:26:39,197
since it's eating cake.

469
00:26:40,688 --> 00:26:43,029
Since it's eating cake, we could

470
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,025
draw a fork in a cute way, too.

471
00:26:59,272 --> 00:27:02,294
We can add small and cute things like

472
00:27:03,195 --> 00:27:05,164
a fork or a plate.

473
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,781
It'll make the canvas look full.

474
00:27:06,806 --> 00:27:10,706
The first impression of this character

475
00:27:10,731 --> 00:27:11,825
needs to be cute.

476
00:27:14,501 --> 00:27:16,027
It's important to make a clear illustration

477
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:19,507
that's also intuitive.

478
00:27:26,608 --> 00:27:29,398
Later on, in the background,

479
00:27:29,502 --> 00:27:31,661
it will be a good idea to

480
00:27:31,686 --> 00:27:32,897
add a pattern like this.

481
00:27:35,909 --> 00:27:37,589
If you keep the character's settings,

482
00:27:37,591 --> 00:27:40,315
you can draw an octopus shape here

483
00:27:43,301 --> 00:27:44,649
or to make it look even more interesting,

484
00:27:44,674 --> 00:27:46,897
try giving this character another kind of food.

485
00:27:46,922 --> 00:27:48,508
Because cakes have been used often.

486
00:27:49,803 --> 00:27:51,355
If you look at the tentacles in the back,

487
00:27:51,357 --> 00:27:53,129
it kind of feels like an octopus.

488
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:55,291
So, the food in the creature's mouth could be a 'takoyaki'.

489
00:27:59,992 --> 00:28:02,105
I've put in some takoyaki.

490
00:28:02,718 --> 00:28:04,389
I'll also sprinkle some 'katsuobushi'.

491
00:28:06,173 --> 00:28:07,686
I'll add some sauce to it, too.

492
00:28:15,785 --> 00:28:18,327
To make it look extra cute,

493
00:28:21,006 --> 00:28:22,913
I'll add an octopus's tentacle.

494
00:28:26,305 --> 00:28:28,866
It's important to make it as round as possible.

495
00:28:28,891 --> 00:28:30,350
We learned it from the lecture regarding silhouettes.

496
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,703
When you apply the silhouette,

497
00:28:32,728 --> 00:28:34,389
of course, it's all included.

498
00:28:35,104 --> 00:28:38,132
When you make cute items, make them as round as possible.

499
00:28:44,281 --> 00:28:46,492
Put some on its mouth, too.

500
00:28:51,998 --> 00:28:54,485
Let's say this side is also eating a big takoyaki.

501
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,653
Like all of them are eating takoyaki together.

502
00:29:17,499 --> 00:29:19,707
Drawing an octopus in the back,

503
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:25,592
we made a cute illustration.

504
00:29:26,658 --> 00:29:29,020
Let's take a look at the before and after.

505
00:29:29,045 --> 00:29:30,365
Of course, by the time it ends,

506
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:32,310
we are going to check if there's anything

507
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,110
we could do better by doing self-feedback.

508
00:29:36,804 --> 00:29:38,924
If you look at the before and after...

509
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,954
Before.

510
00:29:39,974 --> 00:29:41,005
After.

511
00:29:41,016 --> 00:29:42,736
The entire mood changes a lot.

512
00:29:42,911 --> 00:29:45,770
I do think

513
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:47,715
it looks cute.

514
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:48,972
Let's do one more thing.

515
00:29:48,983 --> 00:29:52,164
I said we use multiplication when editing earlier.

516
00:29:52,278 --> 00:29:53,912
How do you use multiplication?

517
00:29:53,914 --> 00:29:55,207
In an illustration like this,

518
00:29:55,232 --> 00:29:56,274
there are a lot of points that draw our attention

519
00:29:56,284 --> 00:29:58,877
in the middle,

520
00:29:58,902 --> 00:30:02,015
so it's okay to have less concentration on the edges.

521
00:30:03,292 --> 00:30:05,285
As such, at times like this,

522
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:07,045
I call this expression,

523
00:30:07,047 --> 00:30:09,230
a fade-out.

524
00:30:09,304 --> 00:30:11,630
It's not a fixed term.

525
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:13,458
So it is...

526
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,911
let's make the edges a bit darker,

527
00:30:18,195 --> 00:30:19,383
like this,

528
00:30:19,408 --> 00:30:21,300
color it dark.

529
00:30:23,313 --> 00:30:24,790
By adjusting the area,

530
00:30:25,855 --> 00:30:27,074
and the color,

531
00:30:28,207 --> 00:30:30,315
make the edges a bit darker.

532
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,219
So you can concentrate more on the center,

533
00:30:32,244 --> 00:30:34,913
which is relatively bright.

534
00:30:35,312 --> 00:30:37,530
Of course, since I wanted to make a bright image,

535
00:30:37,532 --> 00:30:38,706
it shouldn't be too strong.

536
00:30:38,786 --> 00:30:39,997
Adjust the amount,

537
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:45,682
just so that you can focus better

538
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:47,844
in the center.

539
00:30:49,522 --> 00:30:52,331
I tried to make it look cute.

540
00:30:54,297 --> 00:30:57,323
Let's move on to the second one with a calm impression.

541
00:30:57,556 --> 00:30:59,239
You can use some of the things

542
00:30:59,393 --> 00:31:01,128
which we used for the cute impression in an opposite way,

543
00:31:01,153 --> 00:31:04,140
for this calm impression.

544
00:31:04,471 --> 00:31:06,511
Let's start.

545
00:31:07,377 --> 00:31:08,884
Save it first.

546
00:31:26,668 --> 00:31:28,080
When you give a calm impression,

547
00:31:28,105 --> 00:31:30,453
it's okay if the amount of light is less.

548
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:33,486
Because of that, this kind of lighting is pretty useful,

549
00:31:33,511 --> 00:31:36,207
which we went through in the previous lecture.

550
00:31:36,232 --> 00:31:38,809
It's nice to use this kind of lighting.

551
00:31:38,834 --> 00:31:41,592
Since there aren't that many parts where your eyes are gathered,

552
00:31:41,617 --> 00:31:44,573
from the viewer's perspective,

553
00:31:44,598 --> 00:31:47,050
you can observe the drawing more slowly.

554
00:31:47,052 --> 00:31:48,813
These two go really well together.

555
00:31:48,838 --> 00:31:50,667
It's the opposite of the cute image.

556
00:31:50,692 --> 00:31:51,932
When you give me a cute image,

557
00:31:51,934 --> 00:31:54,111
you have to make a strong first impression,

558
00:31:54,113 --> 00:31:56,189
like a refreshing mood.

559
00:31:56,191 --> 00:31:58,119
For this one, it's the opposite.

560
00:31:58,144 --> 00:32:00,106
It's important that

561
00:32:00,131 --> 00:32:02,084
it should be like fine dining food, which you would taste slowly.

562
00:32:04,083 --> 00:32:06,598
So, the overall darkness

563
00:32:20,899 --> 00:32:22,918
has to come in a lot like this.

564
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,115
Even if the amount of light is a bit small.

565
00:32:29,699 --> 00:32:32,709
But, the amount shouldn't be in a 5:5 ratio.

566
00:32:33,473 --> 00:32:34,605
We went through it last time.

567
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:36,565
If the amount of light and darkness

568
00:32:36,567 --> 00:32:39,189
starts to become equal,

569
00:32:39,214 --> 00:32:42,221
from then on, the illustration won't be calm,

570
00:32:42,246 --> 00:32:43,430
but it will become more intense.

571
00:32:43,772 --> 00:32:46,258
So, I won't apply too much black to it.

572
00:32:46,283 --> 00:32:48,868
If I want to give it a lot of darkness,

573
00:32:48,893 --> 00:32:50,333
reduce the contrast as much as possible.

574
00:32:50,358 --> 00:32:51,382
Make it bright like this.

575
00:32:51,674 --> 00:32:53,805
I'll add a shadow that doesn't matter too much.

576
00:32:53,882 --> 00:32:56,688
So, it's important to control

577
00:32:56,713 --> 00:32:59,056
the amount of the dark sections

578
00:32:59,058 --> 00:33:01,783
so that it doesn't become too much.

579
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:10,704
If the main elements and the sub elements are closer to each other,

580
00:33:10,729 --> 00:33:13,104
it will have a cuter impression.

581
00:33:13,582 --> 00:33:17,734
I also mentioned that for calm characters, the opposite applies.

582
00:33:18,391 --> 00:33:22,274
So, like this, the main elements and the sub elements

583
00:33:22,299 --> 00:33:24,794
could be placed far apart.

584
00:33:27,098 --> 00:33:29,330
Let's give it some shade.

585
00:33:32,245 --> 00:33:34,100
I'll just control one part.

586
00:33:34,291 --> 00:33:36,524
I'll adjust the distance, too.

587
00:33:42,205 --> 00:33:43,816
I'll create one Layer.

588
00:33:46,386 --> 00:33:48,619
Let's put this hand down.

589
00:34:07,305 --> 00:34:10,500
Let's put it down and get rid of the hand.

590
00:34:37,754 --> 00:34:38,859
Put it down like this.

591
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,124
I'll make the facial expressions more subtle.

592
00:34:41,271 --> 00:34:42,581
The teeth area here...

593
00:34:42,606 --> 00:34:45,796
it could also be the sub-element

594
00:34:45,797 --> 00:34:48,689
of the face, which is the main element.

595
00:34:52,088 --> 00:34:54,225
It's sad, but let's give it up.

596
00:34:56,516 --> 00:34:58,615
But I'm not going to give up on the expression.

597
00:34:58,897 --> 00:35:00,899
When I came up with this illustration before,

598
00:35:01,008 --> 00:35:03,800
as much as I said I wanted to put in sharp teeth,

599
00:35:03,825 --> 00:35:05,341
I'm going to keep this.

600
00:35:05,524 --> 00:35:07,461
But I'll change the way I show it

601
00:35:12,386 --> 00:35:15,901
and close the mouth like this.

602
00:35:17,594 --> 00:35:19,724
Let's change the expression, too.

603
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,181
I'll make it soft

604
00:35:59,105 --> 00:36:01,420
so that the contrast doesn't get too strong.

605
00:36:03,002 --> 00:36:06,613
I hope that the overall feeling of the drawing can be delivered smoothly.

606
00:36:06,694 --> 00:36:08,520
To fit the calm image,

607
00:36:10,095 --> 00:36:12,852
so that even the viewers can feel it,

608
00:36:13,992 --> 00:36:16,329
I'll reduce the overall contrast.

609
00:36:16,606 --> 00:36:19,515
Let's make the highlight

610
00:36:19,572 --> 00:36:20,601
a bit softer than before.

611
00:36:42,499 --> 00:36:44,410
Let's reduce the description here

612
00:36:44,512 --> 00:36:46,425
so that it feels as soft as possible.

613
00:36:48,093 --> 00:36:51,219
I'm not going to describe the highlights.

614
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,840
The highlights that we made before

615
00:36:53,865 --> 00:36:55,466
went in very strongly, remember?

616
00:36:55,491 --> 00:36:56,719
When we did cute characters, right?

617
00:36:56,993 --> 00:36:58,605
This time, on the contrary,

618
00:36:58,818 --> 00:37:01,594
I'm going to draw a picture

619
00:37:01,596 --> 00:37:02,924
with natural highlights.

620
00:37:03,678 --> 00:37:06,523
In the boundary between the lights and the shadows,

621
00:37:06,548 --> 00:37:09,473
this is the perfect part to increase the amount of description.

622
00:37:10,473 --> 00:37:13,405
People's eyes basically follow

623
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:15,734
the lights and the shadows.

624
00:37:16,185 --> 00:37:17,253
To put it the other way around,

625
00:37:17,278 --> 00:37:19,414
if you work hard on that part,

626
00:37:19,439 --> 00:37:21,881
then it will be a drawing that you worked hard on.

627
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,648
Do your best on the visible areas.

628
00:37:24,989 --> 00:37:27,097
It's like cleaning your living room rather than the whole house.

629
00:37:27,122 --> 00:37:29,607
A first-time visitor will only stay in the living room.

630
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,284
So, just by looking at the living room, they will think the owner cleans well.

631
00:37:32,309 --> 00:37:34,117
They won't even know what happened in the bedrooms.

632
00:37:34,243 --> 00:37:36,090
It's like that.

633
00:37:44,938 --> 00:37:46,743
While drawing the hair,

634
00:37:46,768 --> 00:37:48,529
I'll adjust the eyebrows, too.

635
00:37:49,135 --> 00:37:52,652
Does anyone remember the face chapter?

636
00:37:52,741 --> 00:37:55,625
When we were on the face chapter, we learned that if the eyebrows are high up

637
00:37:55,995 --> 00:37:59,216
and if the facial features are close to each other, it looks cute.

638
00:37:59,463 --> 00:38:02,533
On the other hand, if your eyebrows are close to your eyes,

639
00:38:02,558 --> 00:38:04,715
I said you'd look more mature.

640
00:38:05,961 --> 00:38:08,525
When it comes to calm characters,

641
00:38:08,527 --> 00:38:10,338
they're usually mature characters, not young characters.

642
00:38:10,669 --> 00:38:14,610
So, let's make it look more mature

643
00:38:22,485 --> 00:38:23,941
in the overall impression.

644
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:27,908
I'm going to cut the hair into smaller pieces.

645
00:38:29,577 --> 00:38:31,310
When we drew a cute character before,

646
00:38:31,337 --> 00:38:34,798
it felt like we just made a lump of hair.

647
00:38:34,823 --> 00:38:36,162
This time, on the contrary,

648
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,115
I'm going to split the hair into small pieces.

649
00:38:40,681 --> 00:38:42,073
It's called Hair Strand.

650
00:38:42,098 --> 00:38:44,468
The more hair strands you make,

651
00:38:44,493 --> 00:38:46,532
the more mature the character looks.

652
00:38:46,534 --> 00:38:48,204
I think you learned it during the previous hair session.

653
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:50,605
I'll take advantage of it.

654
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,591
Cut it into small pieces,

655
00:38:53,918 --> 00:38:56,819
to make the character

656
00:38:57,698 --> 00:38:58,853
look more mature.

657
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,667
And looking at the overall flow,

658
00:39:01,692 --> 00:39:04,539
if the main gaze goes down from the head

659
00:39:04,564 --> 00:39:06,966
to the body,

660
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:09,799
due to the hair style,

661
00:39:09,816 --> 00:39:10,972
like these parts,

662
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:13,490
I feel like the gaze is going outwards.

663
00:39:13,779 --> 00:39:16,388
But when you want to give it a calm image,

664
00:39:16,413 --> 00:39:17,805
it's not a good situation.

665
00:39:17,853 --> 00:39:20,349
In a calm image, it'd be good if the parts that the gaze reaches

666
00:39:20,351 --> 00:39:22,311
are neat.

667
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,149
So that you can follow this side slowly.

668
00:39:25,174 --> 00:39:27,134
These items, which are distracting,

669
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:30,333
need to be less unique.

670
00:39:30,613 --> 00:39:31,715
What should we do?

671
00:39:31,725 --> 00:39:33,638
Yes, we need to remove the wind.

672
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:41,004
Let's put it down and make it look calm.

673
00:39:44,878 --> 00:39:46,290
The hair on this side,

674
00:39:46,315 --> 00:39:48,753
getting rid of the existing detail of the hair,

675
00:39:57,287 --> 00:40:00,265
making it calm,

676
00:40:02,793 --> 00:40:06,025
it'd be good if the outfit droops down on the floor as well.

677
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:16,698
Instead of making it come to the foreground,

678
00:40:17,022 --> 00:40:18,680
I'll make it droop down on the floor.

679
00:40:26,583 --> 00:40:28,572
To make people feel

680
00:40:28,582 --> 00:40:31,100
this character is sitting on the floor.

681
00:40:33,093 --> 00:40:36,217
To do that, you can add some shadow

682
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,079
in the background.

683
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,376
I'll give it a blue color.

684
00:40:41,401 --> 00:40:44,171
I'm going to use blue for the overall lighting.

685
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:55,758
The point color part,

686
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:59,740
the parts that have strong colors on this part,

687
00:40:59,765 --> 00:41:02,936
I think it's a section that draws a lot of attention.

688
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:04,751
So, in this part,

689
00:41:04,776 --> 00:41:07,368
I don't like it when people look at it...

690
00:41:07,393 --> 00:41:08,806
Then how can we adjust it?

691
00:41:09,699 --> 00:41:12,475
Use the color range to choose the part you want.

692
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:19,331
The capacity is very low.

693
00:41:19,618 --> 00:41:20,689
I'll put it back up.

694
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,121
Choose the section you want.

695
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,985
I'm going to increase the saturation.

696
00:41:29,797 --> 00:41:31,199
Instead of putting it up,

697
00:41:32,134 --> 00:41:35,426
make sure you don't see the parts where there's no light,

698
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:36,715
I'm going to make it dark.

699
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,945
People get to see the boundary

700
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:42,135
of the darkness and brightness first,

701
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,784
and after that, the bright places come later.

702
00:41:46,661 --> 00:41:49,019
You see where the light comes from first.

703
00:41:51,589 --> 00:41:53,572
When you go to see a performance,

704
00:41:53,597 --> 00:41:57,005
we can't not spotlight the main character.

705
00:41:57,363 --> 00:41:59,844
You need to give a strong light to the main character.

706
00:42:01,901 --> 00:42:04,712
Naturally, our eyes follow the areas with a lot of light.

707
00:42:20,999 --> 00:42:22,567
Then, like this,

708
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:26,474
to make sure the gaze doesn't go towards the dark area,

709
00:42:26,492 --> 00:42:28,512
detail it as little as possible.

710
00:42:29,665 --> 00:42:31,246
The parts we have to detail the most

711
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:32,836
are the parts that are visible.

712
00:42:33,378 --> 00:42:35,615
Try detailing these parts,

713
00:42:39,678 --> 00:42:42,725
and you can erase the whole part

714
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:46,545
where there's a relatively invisible section of darkness.

715
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,835
You'll feel at ease

716
00:42:49,995 --> 00:42:51,328
because you don't have to depict it.

717
00:42:53,558 --> 00:42:55,791
At least I hope so, but

718
00:42:55,886 --> 00:42:57,845
some students suffer more

719
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:59,530
when they don't have to depict it.

720
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:03,229
They may feel like they have to depict it no matter what.

721
00:43:03,693 --> 00:43:05,265
There are some people like that.

722
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:07,570
I'll tell you more about that

723
00:43:07,595 --> 00:43:09,236
as I go into the descriptive stage, but,

724
00:43:09,482 --> 00:43:12,699
you just have to make sure the detail goes in the right area.

725
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:15,730
You don't have to put a lot of effort into the whole illustration.

726
00:43:15,976 --> 00:43:19,312
If that was the case, then the people who draw an illustration a day

727
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:20,884
would be like Superman.

728
00:43:20,997 --> 00:43:22,510
Of course, they are like Superman, but

729
00:43:27,005 --> 00:43:28,675
when it comes to illustration, detail is

730
00:43:28,801 --> 00:43:31,011
not really necessary for all areas.

731
00:43:31,902 --> 00:43:34,143
This is especially the case for casual illustrations.

732
00:43:34,402 --> 00:43:36,445
If you draw realistic illustrations,

733
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:38,296
detail is more important, obviously.

734
00:43:38,694 --> 00:43:42,252
So, those people have to depict things in detail.

735
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:44,292
For those who draw casual illustrations,

736
00:43:44,317 --> 00:43:47,006
you don't have to think about it too much.

737
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:50,866
You don't have to detail every part of the illustration.

738
00:43:50,891 --> 00:43:52,367
You don't have to depict all the creases.

739
00:43:52,392 --> 00:43:54,623
You don't have to do that.

740
00:43:57,403 --> 00:43:59,200
That's all for now.

741
00:43:59,233 --> 00:44:01,654
Let's take a look at the before and after images.

742
00:44:01,911 --> 00:44:03,055
The before,

743
00:44:07,388 --> 00:44:08,433
and the after.

744
00:44:08,611 --> 00:44:10,993
You can see that the character has gotten quite calm.

745
00:44:11,027 --> 00:44:12,667
The mouth went down too much.

746
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:14,007
Let's raise it a little bit.

747
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:23,440
Because the mouth is closed

748
00:44:23,442 --> 00:44:25,249
the chin will go up a bit.

749
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:27,310
Let's fix the chin, too.

750
00:44:27,881 --> 00:44:30,227
I think the chin became longer because of this.

751
00:44:38,307 --> 00:44:42,213
But the overall impression started to get calmer.

752
00:44:47,778 --> 00:44:49,750
I'm going to add some sparkly highlights now.

753
00:44:49,752 --> 00:44:52,727
Unlike the previous example, where I used a ton of highlights,

754
00:44:53,134 --> 00:44:56,398
I'm not going to use a lot of highlights for this drawing.

755
00:44:57,719 --> 00:45:00,147
It's good to give it a sparkly feeling.

756
00:45:00,172 --> 00:45:02,478
Otherwise, the character will look sad.

757
00:45:02,503 --> 00:45:06,177
I didn't want it to be that calm,

758
00:45:06,179 --> 00:45:09,904
so I'm going to add some shiny objects.

759
00:45:09,906 --> 00:45:12,895
But by putting in just a small amount,

760
00:45:14,413 --> 00:45:16,453
it won't feel like it's flashy.

761
00:45:17,903 --> 00:45:21,033
I'll add highlights

762
00:45:28,485 --> 00:45:30,814
so that it looks brilliant.

763
00:45:46,801 --> 00:45:49,596
It's good to use the air perspective at this stage.

764
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:50,653
Air perspective.

765
00:45:50,663 --> 00:45:53,594
The things that are in the background would be mixed with the color of the air.

766
00:45:53,619 --> 00:45:55,427
So, it becomes the same color as the background.

767
00:45:55,429 --> 00:45:57,107
That's what happens.

768
00:45:57,187 --> 00:46:01,081
It's usually applied to mountains far away.

769
00:46:01,172 --> 00:46:04,211
But it's often placed inside the character.

770
00:46:04,385 --> 00:46:06,775
It's especially like this when it comes to casual characters.

771
00:46:06,915 --> 00:46:07,924
Why are we doing this?

772
00:46:07,949 --> 00:46:09,796
Casual characters have relatively

773
00:46:09,821 --> 00:46:13,144
less information compared to photographs.

774
00:46:13,222 --> 00:46:15,917
There aren't many parts where you can express the three-dimensional effects.

775
00:46:16,675 --> 00:46:19,609
That's why the drawing becomes flat.

776
00:46:19,634 --> 00:46:21,196
In that flat image,

777
00:46:21,198 --> 00:46:22,917
if you apply air perspective,

778
00:46:23,017 --> 00:46:24,311
like this,

779
00:46:25,808 --> 00:46:27,298
objects with air perspective would be

780
00:46:27,323 --> 00:46:29,732
way behind this character.

781
00:46:29,806 --> 00:46:33,369
So, the frontal areas and the back areas would be divided.

782
00:46:33,394 --> 00:46:35,907
You can think of it as if the layers are being created.

783
00:46:36,306 --> 00:46:38,597
The first one doesn't have air perspective applied,

784
00:46:38,622 --> 00:46:41,003
the one in the middle has a bit of air perspective applied,

785
00:46:41,386 --> 00:46:43,902
and the one in the back has a lot of air perspective applied.

786
00:46:43,982 --> 00:46:46,728
So, it's divided into several layers.

787
00:46:46,753 --> 00:46:49,123
And the drawing gives a more three-dimensional impression.

788
00:46:49,403 --> 00:46:51,663
So when you draw casual illustrations,

789
00:46:51,665 --> 00:46:53,588
you would use air perspective often.

790
00:46:57,827 --> 00:46:59,698
So, let's make sure

791
00:47:01,104 --> 00:47:02,798
that the objects that are behind

792
00:47:05,596 --> 00:47:07,551
won't be visible.

793
00:47:14,208 --> 00:47:16,418
Make sure the hat is highlighted even less.

794
00:47:16,585 --> 00:47:22,190
Do the same for the hand in the background.

795
00:47:25,189 --> 00:47:27,244
So, the areas that you see

796
00:47:27,254 --> 00:47:29,119
will become smaller.

797
00:47:35,512 --> 00:47:38,720
Then, you can focus on the visible areas.

798
00:47:42,581 --> 00:47:45,686
Looking at the difference between the previous illustration and the flow of the gaze,

799
00:47:45,697 --> 00:47:47,447
in the previous illustration,

800
00:47:47,457 --> 00:47:49,307
it looked like the eyes go back and forth,

801
00:47:49,308 --> 00:47:50,750
while in this illustration,

802
00:47:50,775 --> 00:47:53,703
they only stay here.

803
00:47:54,473 --> 00:47:57,265
And in this cute illustration,

804
00:47:57,267 --> 00:47:59,405
you'll be able to see the gaze spreading overall.

805
00:48:01,785 --> 00:48:03,995
The gaze of this calm illustration,

806
00:48:03,997 --> 00:48:05,415
had to move calmly,

807
00:48:05,425 --> 00:48:07,211
literally, calmly

808
00:48:07,236 --> 00:48:09,131
and slowly.

809
00:48:09,156 --> 00:48:13,826
So we are building those things into this kind of composition.

810
00:48:47,732 --> 00:48:52,429
And add some details using the Lasso Tool.

811
00:49:07,012 --> 00:49:09,512
And make the dark areas darker.

812
00:49:18,092 --> 00:49:20,233
When we were creating a cute character,

813
00:49:20,258 --> 00:49:21,835
we used some cute items.

814
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:22,881
In a similar way,

815
00:49:23,688 --> 00:49:26,448
it'd be nice to use items that match the calm character.

816
00:49:26,473 --> 00:49:28,991
There's a limit to what we can use in this situation,

817
00:49:29,017 --> 00:49:31,020
but if I have to choose one of my favorite elements,

818
00:49:31,045 --> 00:49:32,719
I like liquid,

819
00:49:33,483 --> 00:49:34,710
something like water.

820
00:49:35,503 --> 00:49:37,920
So you can make the surface of the floor like this,

821
00:49:52,388 --> 00:49:54,815
or put the character in the water.

822
00:49:55,196 --> 00:49:56,528
The submerged part,

823
00:49:56,553 --> 00:49:59,968
since water blocks the light to a certain extent,

824
00:50:01,912 --> 00:50:03,664
you can't see deep underwater.

825
00:50:03,689 --> 00:50:05,208
But we can see the surface.

826
00:50:05,593 --> 00:50:09,716
Like that, since the water itself blocks the light to a certain extent,

827
00:50:10,727 --> 00:50:13,675
the characters that are submerged can get dark.

828
00:50:18,713 --> 00:50:21,317
It's good to know,

829
00:50:24,714 --> 00:50:26,811
when you study the lighting in more detail,

830
00:50:26,836 --> 00:50:30,399
but it's okay to recognize that the water is dark.

831
00:50:38,388 --> 00:50:40,185
To make it simple,

832
00:50:40,525 --> 00:50:41,785
it works like this.

833
00:50:42,391 --> 00:50:46,034
When light enters the surface of the water,

834
00:50:46,059 --> 00:50:47,429
the light gets refracted.

835
00:50:47,454 --> 00:50:49,755
If we put chopsticks in the water,

836
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:52,095
you've probably seen that the chopsticks look bent.

837
00:50:52,170 --> 00:50:54,408
Like that, the light gets refracted.

838
00:50:54,433 --> 00:50:56,025
In the process of refraction,

839
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:59,517
normal light bounces out like this.

840
00:51:00,321 --> 00:51:02,060
And then it bounces out from here.

841
00:51:02,208 --> 00:51:04,194
There's a light that disappears like this, right?

842
00:51:04,219 --> 00:51:07,790
So if it only has 2/3 of it,

843
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:10,033
then, 1/3 of the light is not in it.

844
00:51:10,035 --> 00:51:11,463
Rather than the light here,

845
00:51:11,465 --> 00:51:14,273
the amount of light that goes in here is less.

846
00:51:14,298 --> 00:51:15,902
Please keep it in mind.

847
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:19,634
Let's come back.

848
00:51:19,824 --> 00:51:21,705
I'll continue to draw waves.

849
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:25,790
The theme of the wave itself...

850
00:51:25,815 --> 00:51:27,820
When I give a calm impression,

851
00:51:27,845 --> 00:51:29,815
I think it's a good item.

852
00:51:31,179 --> 00:51:33,198
It also raises the details of the drawing,

853
00:51:34,489 --> 00:51:37,088
and when it comes to water, it's calm

854
00:51:38,308 --> 00:51:39,403
and quiet.

855
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:42,209
You get that impression, right?

856
00:51:45,285 --> 00:51:47,585
We know about the general impressions

857
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:49,933
of those images.

858
00:51:50,771 --> 00:51:52,542
When it comes to water, it's calm.

859
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:54,490
When it comes to fire, it's burning.

860
00:51:54,974 --> 00:51:56,975
80 to 90 percent of us get similar impressions

861
00:51:56,977 --> 00:52:01,099
with these.

862
00:52:01,489 --> 00:52:04,240
If there's an image

863
00:52:04,265 --> 00:52:05,978
that you don't know,

864
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:07,086
you just have to know it now.

865
00:52:07,111 --> 00:52:10,521
I think it's good to keep directing to match those images,

866
00:52:10,523 --> 00:52:14,123
so that the character can be expressed

867
00:52:14,148 --> 00:52:16,190
in the mood that you want.

868
00:52:18,205 --> 00:52:20,435
So, the biggest purpose of our class is

869
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:23,210
to draw as we intended to.

870
00:52:23,392 --> 00:52:25,808
You can make that happen.

871
00:52:36,954 --> 00:52:39,923
Water drops will be a small highlight.

872
00:52:44,606 --> 00:52:47,413
The one in the back opened their mouth.

873
00:52:47,887 --> 00:52:49,637
But when you give a calm impression like now,

874
00:52:49,639 --> 00:52:51,333
I think it's okay to keep its mouth closed.

875
00:52:53,082 --> 00:52:54,908
Because it stands out too much.

876
00:52:54,975 --> 00:52:57,522
So the character in the front looks weaker than before.

877
00:52:57,688 --> 00:53:00,487
Therefore, if the character in the back is still there,

878
00:53:00,621 --> 00:53:02,865
I think it's going to eat the one in the front.

879
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:09,470
So to prevent it, adjust it

880
00:53:14,801 --> 00:53:15,821
little by little.

881
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:31,510
So I changed it like this, to make the eyes shiny.

882
00:53:44,568 --> 00:53:48,422
Like this, in one impression.

883
00:53:50,157 --> 00:53:51,807
Once, in a cute way,

884
00:53:52,503 --> 00:53:54,383
and once,

885
00:53:54,585 --> 00:53:55,627
in a calm way.

886
00:53:55,693 --> 00:53:58,826
Let's put them side by side.

887
00:54:21,279 --> 00:54:23,296
I put them side by side like this.

888
00:54:31,594 --> 00:54:35,194
My first impression changed a lot.

889
00:54:35,196 --> 00:54:37,990
As I said in the beginning,

890
00:54:38,015 --> 00:54:39,700
you can see that different atmospheres such as cute or calm moods

891
00:54:39,702 --> 00:54:41,614
are strengthened.

892
00:54:41,881 --> 00:54:44,724
When we direct the illustrations like this,

893
00:54:44,749 --> 00:54:47,574
a lot of things are combined into it.

894
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:49,525
For example, the colors,

895
00:54:50,498 --> 00:54:51,920
the lighting,

896
00:54:52,459 --> 00:54:53,713
the details,

897
00:54:54,285 --> 00:54:55,826
the highlights,

898
00:54:55,985 --> 00:54:57,643
or the small items.

899
00:54:57,668 --> 00:55:01,495
So, with directing, a lot of things can be utilized.

900
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,081
So I'm going to use those

901
00:55:03,106 --> 00:55:05,508
to direct this image

902
00:55:05,533 --> 00:55:07,248
the way we want.

903
00:55:07,273 --> 00:55:09,537
I think that's the most important part of the illustration.

904
00:55:09,870 --> 00:55:11,333
Because of that,

905
00:55:11,358 --> 00:55:13,051
it's best that

906
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:15,156
you get the same results like the image you first thought of.

907
00:55:15,291 --> 00:55:18,341
If you can't do that, do it like this in the middle process

908
00:55:18,366 --> 00:55:20,433
and think if there are better ways to direct

909
00:55:21,259 --> 00:55:23,490
as you work on it.

910
00:55:23,515 --> 00:55:25,130
I told you this earlier.

911
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,021
You should choose between two items.

912
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:29,708
If you make extreme choices,

913
00:55:29,875 --> 00:55:31,785
you'll be able to

914
00:55:31,810 --> 00:55:33,188
express the image you want to.

915
00:55:33,267 --> 00:55:35,582
That's the main purpose of our class.

916
00:55:35,607 --> 00:55:38,615
Ask yourself questions while drawing.

917
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:40,970
You should ask yourself

918
00:55:40,995 --> 00:55:44,142
whether your illustration is headed in the direction you want it to go.

919
00:55:44,262 --> 00:55:46,809
It's something that people don't do often.

920
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,864
So other than the current illustration,

921
00:55:49,889 --> 00:55:52,839
if there's a drawing that you drew before this class,

922
00:55:52,864 --> 00:55:54,610
take a look at it,

923
00:55:54,797 --> 00:55:57,114
and check if it was created the way you intended.

924
00:55:57,478 --> 00:56:00,665
Ask yourself, if something was missing, what was it.

925
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:03,716
If you think about it, it'll be time well spent.

926
00:56:04,385 --> 00:56:06,400
We said we're going to have some self-feedback time, right?

927
00:56:06,425 --> 00:56:07,790
So, let's get to it.

928
00:56:08,177 --> 00:56:11,582
This one on the right has a calm impression.

929
00:56:11,607 --> 00:56:14,930
But, I think it's disappointing that the overall color is bland.

930
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:17,387
I only used mint color a lot.

931
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:20,348
To fill in this area,

932
00:56:20,373 --> 00:56:22,933
it would be nice to add some color near the border.

933
00:56:24,368 --> 00:56:28,711
But if it's too colorful, it'll be cute.

934
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,121
We don't want to do that, so

935
00:56:31,146 --> 00:56:32,403
it will be good to apply blue.

936
00:56:36,402 --> 00:56:38,148
Just this much.

937
00:56:46,095 --> 00:56:47,624
Let's add in some colors.

938
00:57:05,479 --> 00:57:09,418
If I do this, I think the image will be prettier.

939
00:57:13,885 --> 00:57:17,200
With the second one, including the hair color,

940
00:57:17,202 --> 00:57:21,414
it gives the impression that I rushed with the contrast.

941
00:57:21,485 --> 00:57:25,518
So, to make these parts look more natural,

942
00:57:27,588 --> 00:57:29,199
it would be nice to adjust it.

943
00:57:29,898 --> 00:57:32,877
You can brighten the hair a bit,

944
00:57:39,865 --> 00:57:41,798
or change the color a bit.

945
00:57:44,897 --> 00:57:47,132
And for the colors in the background,

946
00:57:47,134 --> 00:57:49,178
I think they could be applied differently.

947
00:57:49,885 --> 00:57:51,412
I'll choose like this.

948
00:57:54,375 --> 00:57:56,497
Since we used a lot of blue for this character,

949
00:57:56,499 --> 00:57:57,651
and because blue and yellow

950
00:57:57,676 --> 00:57:59,833
are opposite colors on the color wheel,

951
00:58:02,169 --> 00:58:05,802
it gives the illustration too much information.

952
00:58:06,298 --> 00:58:08,224
So to avoid that,

953
00:58:14,078 --> 00:58:16,437
I'll apply light green like this.

954
00:58:32,385 --> 00:58:35,934
And you'll get the feeling that your eyes are too distracted.

955
00:58:35,936 --> 00:58:38,533
This is because we increased the amount of information

956
00:58:38,535 --> 00:58:39,979
that could be shown.

957
00:58:40,233 --> 00:58:41,252
Now then,

958
00:58:41,254 --> 00:58:44,211
I'm going to make areas that aren't visible.

959
00:58:44,386 --> 00:58:46,002
How can I do that?

960
00:58:47,157 --> 00:58:50,407
Like I did with the example on the right, I could block the light like this.

961
00:58:53,182 --> 00:58:55,396
Or, let's make an area for the eyes to rest.

962
00:58:55,421 --> 00:58:57,231
You can make areas

963
00:58:57,256 --> 00:58:58,807
that don't have to be seen.

964
00:59:01,306 --> 00:59:03,070
You can go back up there.

965
00:59:03,072 --> 00:59:04,092
Kind of like this.

966
00:59:09,792 --> 00:59:11,692
Drawing is about controlling the gaze.

967
00:59:11,717 --> 00:59:13,415
You need to control the gaze of the viewers

968
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:17,459
to make sure they see the area you want to show.

969
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:20,251
It's the most important task.

970
00:59:22,086 --> 00:59:25,018
That's how you put in your intention.

971
00:59:33,866 --> 00:59:37,021
If you feel the light is coming from the right side,

972
00:59:38,888 --> 00:59:39,892
a frontal light,

973
00:59:39,894 --> 00:59:41,358
a light from the front,

974
00:59:41,383 --> 00:59:42,939
and the light hitting from the side...

975
00:59:42,941 --> 00:59:44,995
Between these, I think it'd be the light from the side.

976
00:59:44,997 --> 00:59:46,844
I think it may look a bit calmer.

977
00:59:46,869 --> 00:59:48,220
So I think the light from the front

978
00:59:48,221 --> 00:59:50,191
would be for more of a cute character.

979
00:59:51,305 --> 00:59:54,288
Let's move the direction of the light to the front.

980
01:00:01,012 --> 01:00:03,427
I'm going to make a heart.

981
01:00:06,142 --> 01:00:09,690
Or since it's a bit awkward if there's red all of a sudden,

982
01:00:11,198 --> 01:00:14,146
maybe a blue heart to match the character's color,

983
01:00:15,881 --> 01:00:18,460
or by using this character's appearance,

984
01:00:18,485 --> 01:00:20,191
which is a bit scary,

985
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:24,757
you can draw something like this.

986
01:00:30,372 --> 01:00:33,518
You can keep adjusting it.

987
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:35,833
By changing the facial expressions

988
01:00:35,883 --> 01:00:38,393
to fit your image.

989
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:40,742
This is self-feedback.

990
01:00:40,889 --> 01:00:43,142
While working on this process,

991
01:00:43,195 --> 01:00:44,828
if you put it

992
01:00:46,192 --> 01:00:48,989
in between the processes,

993
01:00:49,884 --> 01:00:53,137
it may take longer to finish.

994
01:00:53,168 --> 01:00:56,148
But you'll be able to draw the illustration exactly as you intended.

995
01:00:58,106 --> 01:00:59,833
So today, using the left one

996
01:01:00,276 --> 01:01:03,405
which we worked with when doing rough coloring,

997
01:01:03,825 --> 01:01:06,524
we made two moods.

998
01:01:07,143 --> 01:01:08,379
In the next class,

999
01:01:08,389 --> 01:01:10,389
we're going to make a different mood like this.

1000
01:01:10,907 --> 01:01:14,523
If you followed along while drawing,

1001
01:01:14,583 --> 01:01:16,962
try to edit the illustrations

1002
01:01:16,987 --> 01:01:19,375
that you drew.

1003
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,121
When you first compose the illustration,

1004
01:01:21,131 --> 01:01:22,970
if there's a reference you referred to,

1005
01:01:22,995 --> 01:01:26,235
and if you want to change the current mood,

1006
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:27,722
get a new reference.

1007
01:01:27,747 --> 01:01:29,898
I think it's good to refer to a reference when you work on it.

1008
01:01:29,923 --> 01:01:30,995
It's really good.

1009
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:32,801
Having said that,

1010
01:01:32,888 --> 01:01:35,283
I'll end today's class.

1011
01:01:35,405 --> 01:01:36,492
Thank you for your support.
