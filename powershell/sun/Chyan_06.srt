00:00:05,876 --> 00:00:06,803
Hello.

3
00:00:06,828 --> 00:00:10,125
Today, we'll learn about hair and the creases on clothes.

4
00:00:10,203 --> 00:00:13,136
Previously, we learned how to draw a human body

5
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:14,465
with the correct proportions,

6
00:00:14,489 --> 00:00:17,476
though it may have been simplistic.

7
00:00:17,578 --> 00:00:19,708
We also learned

8
00:00:19,709 --> 00:00:21,882
how to move the body

9
00:00:22,085 --> 00:00:26,129
and how to draw its face.

10
00:00:26,131 --> 00:00:27,842
I'll teach today's lecture with that in mind.

11
00:00:27,867 --> 00:00:30,670
Theoretically, in this stage,

12
00:00:30,672 --> 00:00:32,237
now that there's the face

13
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:33,717
there would be hair,

14
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:35,584
and if you can clothe it,

15
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:38,345
you can say that

16
00:00:38,357 --> 00:00:39,984
you can draw a character.

17
00:00:40,101 --> 00:00:41,600
As I previously mentioned,

18
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:44,554
Section 2 isn't about

19
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,771
improving your skills right away.

20
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:51,109
You should practice on your own - that's what's important.

21
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,703
You would build up your experience

22
00:00:53,728 --> 00:00:57,217
and improve on your drawing skills.

23
00:00:57,242 --> 00:00:58,975
If you think you need more practice,

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,523
invest in a lot of time for one piece

25
00:01:02,548 --> 00:01:06,289
and apply what you've learned accurately.

26
00:01:06,314 --> 00:01:08,703
Then, you'd be able to draw a character.

27
00:01:08,728 --> 00:01:12,075
Of course, the detailed outlines of the muscles and the bones

28
00:01:12,077 --> 00:01:14,476
would be somewhat omitted.

29
00:01:14,501 --> 00:01:15,803
But, you'll still be able to

30
00:01:15,828 --> 00:01:19,000
draw a character's basic form.

31
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:23,006
Today, I'll start with the hair

32
00:01:23,008 --> 00:01:25,428
and move on to the creases of clothes.

33
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:28,828
With them, you can apply deformers.

34
00:01:28,853 --> 00:01:30,455
You might ask if that is something natural.

35
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:32,765
Because we usually don't draw every single strand of hair

36
00:01:32,807 --> 00:01:34,667
and instead draw them in lumps,

37
00:01:34,669 --> 00:01:36,398
the Deformer is already applied.

38
00:01:36,423 --> 00:01:38,569
But, the Deformer I'm talking about

39
00:01:38,571 --> 00:01:40,771
goes beyond just that.

40
00:01:40,796 --> 00:01:43,890
In fact, with the creases and hair,

41
00:01:44,485 --> 00:01:46,250
you can show a character's personality,

42
00:01:46,275 --> 00:01:48,934
their setting,

43
00:01:48,936 --> 00:01:52,400
or their overall atmosphere,

44
00:01:52,402 --> 00:01:54,201
either directly or indirectly.

45
00:01:54,226 --> 00:01:55,764
Let's take hair, for example.

46
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:59,470
If a character who is like a career woman

47
00:01:59,472 --> 00:02:02,108
has really messy hair,

48
00:02:02,132 --> 00:02:03,812
it could look awkward.

49
00:02:03,837 --> 00:02:05,334
On the other hand, a little kid

50
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:08,218
who has long, calm hair

51
00:02:08,243 --> 00:02:09,928
could also look awkward.

52
00:02:10,117 --> 00:02:13,781
With clothing, take a CEO wearing a hoodie

53
00:02:14,015 --> 00:02:16,425
or an elementary school kid in a suit.

54
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:18,651
Sounds awkward, right?

55
00:02:18,653 --> 00:02:22,031
So, as you might have guessed,

56
00:02:22,056 --> 00:02:24,429
we can give meaning to the hair and clothes.

57
00:02:24,431 --> 00:02:25,543
These would, in turn,

58
00:02:25,567 --> 00:02:27,920
tell us the character's story.

59
00:02:27,945 --> 00:02:30,053
So, please remember that

60
00:02:30,078 --> 00:02:33,531
we apply deformers to the hair and the clothes.

61
00:02:33,556 --> 00:02:35,248
In some animations, you may have scenes

62
00:02:35,273 --> 00:02:38,171
where a character's hair stands up when they're surprised

63
00:02:39,335 --> 00:02:41,479
or when a character has strands of hair sticking out

64
00:02:41,504 --> 00:02:43,796
to show that they're sleepy.

65
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:47,953
There are also scenes where their hair goes down when they become calm.

66
00:02:47,978 --> 00:02:50,448
Because the hair tells a lot of stories,

67
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:53,304
keep in mind that it's important.

68
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,295
But, before I go on,

69
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,859
let's review

70
00:02:58,884 --> 00:03:01,500
what we learned in the previous lecture.

71
00:03:02,046 --> 00:03:04,406
I'll just go over the most important things.

72
00:03:04,695 --> 00:03:06,553
I went over what's important

73
00:03:06,578 --> 00:03:09,100
when you're drawing a character's head.

74
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,523
First, the eye socket.

75
00:03:11,632 --> 00:03:14,679
The eye itself has some thickness to it.

76
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,914
If I add one more thing to this, I told you that

77
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:21,092
the eyelid bone where the eyebrow is located

78
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:23,210
is the sharpest part.

79
00:03:23,235 --> 00:03:24,818
So, when you're looking at it sideways,

80
00:03:24,843 --> 00:03:27,334
this would be the part where the skull bulges out the most,

81
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:28,625
aside from the nose.

82
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,943
So, this eyelid bone bulges out the most.

83
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,951
Remember I told you a character looks cuter

84
00:03:33,976 --> 00:03:36,632
as the eyebrow goes up?

85
00:03:36,796 --> 00:03:39,906
The skull shape changes a bit when you change the eyebrow position.

86
00:03:40,089 --> 00:03:41,983
For example, characters who look calm like this,

87
00:03:41,985 --> 00:03:45,482
have very deep eye sockets

88
00:03:45,484 --> 00:03:48,617
especially if the eyebrows and the eyes

89
00:03:52,105 --> 00:03:53,039
are close to each other.

90
00:03:55,398 --> 00:03:58,803
Remember that they have deep eye sockets.

91
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:01,884
On the other hand, characters with higher eyebrows

92
00:04:01,886 --> 00:04:03,507
will have their eyes here

93
00:04:05,391 --> 00:04:06,406
like this

94
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:11,710
and their eyelid bone will be less bulging

95
00:04:11,735 --> 00:04:14,209
and it will spread out more.

96
00:04:14,234 --> 00:04:17,342
So, you will now understand this part more easily.

97
00:04:17,367 --> 00:04:19,537
When we're drawing a character,

98
00:04:19,562 --> 00:04:22,526
we usually put the eyebrows far apart from the eyes.

99
00:04:22,828 --> 00:04:24,537
So, the profile of the face

100
00:04:24,562 --> 00:04:27,203
doesn't have a sharp curve.

101
00:04:27,812 --> 00:04:31,445
Because it's important to express the eye socket correctly,

102
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:35,468
please take some time to study this part.

103
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,550
And, to give you additional information,

104
00:04:44,552 --> 00:04:48,054
some of you struggle with drawing the chin.

105
00:04:48,218 --> 00:04:51,975
Usually, a female character's chin is in a V shape.

106
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,523
Remember when I taught you about skulls,

107
00:04:55,765 --> 00:04:59,039
I mentioned the chin bulges out forwards?

108
00:04:59,148 --> 00:05:02,386
There is a small bone right here

109
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,289
in a triangular shape.

110
00:05:05,015 --> 00:05:06,969
Of course, this bone isn't made up of many parts.

111
00:05:06,971 --> 00:05:08,131
It's just one bone.

112
00:05:08,156 --> 00:05:11,959
It's easier to understand

113
00:05:11,984 --> 00:05:13,601
if you understand it as a sharp triangular bone.

114
00:05:13,626 --> 00:05:16,320
With female characters, that part becomes more evident.

115
00:05:16,322 --> 00:05:19,984
And with male characters, it's not as evident.

116
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:23,351
So, we can say a character is more masculine if they have a rectangular chin.

117
00:05:23,376 --> 00:05:25,568
So, when you're drawing a guy,

118
00:05:25,593 --> 00:05:27,915
you'll usually draw a rectangular chin.

119
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,296
Still, their chin will bulge out a bit.

120
00:05:30,321 --> 00:05:33,670
Remember, the jaw bones

121
00:05:33,695 --> 00:05:35,117
will always bulge out.

122
00:05:38,507 --> 00:05:40,421
Now, the face.

123
00:05:40,446 --> 00:05:44,548
This point of the ear is in the same height as the eyes.

124
00:05:44,828 --> 00:05:48,033
Just remember that this area was the

125
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:52,193
important part of the temporal region.

126
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:54,304
So, now I'll attach the hair to these characters.

127
00:05:54,466 --> 00:05:56,776
Let's analyze the hair parts, shall we?

128
00:05:56,778 --> 00:05:59,285
I've mentioned that the hair is largely divided into

129
00:05:59,309 --> 00:06:01,500
the front hair, the side hair, and the back hair.

130
00:06:01,502 --> 00:06:03,558
If we divide these parts again,

131
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:06,699
the side hair sticks to the area

132
00:06:06,724 --> 00:06:09,324
right in front of the ears.

133
00:06:14,501 --> 00:06:16,801
So that was where the side hair is located.

134
00:06:18,887 --> 00:06:22,019
Of course, at its front, there would be the front hair.

135
00:06:22,371 --> 00:06:24,582
And this would be the back hair.

136
00:06:25,105 --> 00:06:28,240
So, you can largely divide

137
00:06:28,242 --> 00:06:29,980
the hair into three parts.

138
00:06:30,005 --> 00:06:33,054
Now, you should be able to divide them into smaller parts.

139
00:06:33,056 --> 00:06:35,484
In the end, drawing the hair is all about

140
00:06:35,508 --> 00:06:37,246
dividing it into small parts.

141
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:39,145
With hair,

142
00:06:39,518 --> 00:06:42,050
I'll first go over things

143
00:06:42,052 --> 00:06:44,535
that are important when you divide hair.

144
00:06:45,293 --> 00:06:46,838
The important thing

145
00:06:46,863 --> 00:06:53,063
is first, you should think of the big parts

146
00:06:56,918 --> 00:06:58,426
and the small parts separately.

147
00:06:59,465 --> 00:07:00,767
In real life,

148
00:07:00,769 --> 00:07:03,833
our hair isn't all together

149
00:07:03,835 --> 00:07:05,142
in a neat form.

150
00:07:05,144 --> 00:07:07,621
A character would have lumps of hair.

151
00:07:07,754 --> 00:07:09,445
So, when we're describing hair,

152
00:07:09,469 --> 00:07:12,138
and if we don't divide it into big and small parts,

153
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,527
it will overall be poorly arranged.

154
00:07:15,552 --> 00:07:18,174
It will also be confusing

155
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:19,859
how you should arrange the hair

156
00:07:19,883 --> 00:07:21,012
and how you should describe it

157
00:07:21,037 --> 00:07:22,426
while thinking of a specific hairstyle.

158
00:07:22,589 --> 00:07:25,197
So, dividing hair into big and small parts

159
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,004
will have a big impact on important decisions later.

160
00:07:28,422 --> 00:07:30,144
Such as irregularity.

161
00:07:35,094 --> 00:07:36,170
I told you before

162
00:07:36,172 --> 00:07:38,650
that it is good to draw hair irregularly.

163
00:07:38,652 --> 00:07:43,135
If it is too neat, it won't look human.

164
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,402
It will be unnatural

165
00:07:46,793 --> 00:07:47,806
and stiff.

166
00:07:47,808 --> 00:07:50,418
Many people will find it unnatural.

167
00:07:50,707 --> 00:07:52,722
It also won't have a nice aesthetic.

168
00:07:53,324 --> 00:07:55,990
Even design-wise, it is not good to have

169
00:07:56,015 --> 00:07:58,762
repetitive regular patterns.

170
00:07:58,926 --> 00:08:01,514
So, to add in irregular elements,

171
00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:04,335
we are dividing the hair

172
00:08:04,337 --> 00:08:06,808
into big and small parts.

173
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:09,885
And, if we choose one more thing that's important,

174
00:08:09,887 --> 00:08:11,609
it's that they shouldn't be flat.

175
00:08:15,722 --> 00:08:17,315
Make the hair three-dimensional.

176
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,137
For this concept,

177
00:08:20,755 --> 00:08:24,528
you might actually have heard of it before.

178
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:27,441
The hair itself is like a huge side.

179
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:32,229
And because it is covering the head,

180
00:08:32,254 --> 00:08:35,750
it is three-dimensional, not flat.

181
00:08:35,751 --> 00:08:38,024
You might have seen this concept

182
00:08:38,025 --> 00:08:40,389
in another lecture

183
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,799
or from a YouTube video.

184
00:08:42,801 --> 00:08:44,971
What I'm doing today is similar to that.

185
00:08:44,996 --> 00:08:46,190
However,

186
00:08:46,215 --> 00:08:49,660
I'll also tell you how to approach this more easily.

187
00:08:49,793 --> 00:08:52,121
In addition, I'll pinpoint

188
00:08:52,504 --> 00:08:56,316
where you should change your perception regarding the hair.

189
00:08:57,676 --> 00:08:59,470
So, let's get to it.

190
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:00,972
I've mentioned that

191
00:09:01,418 --> 00:09:03,330
you should divide hair into big and small parts.

192
00:09:03,355 --> 00:09:06,666
The front hair, side hair, and the back hair,

193
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:10,316
these three parts would be the big parts.

194
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:14,629
So, would you just have to divide it randomly?

195
00:09:14,824 --> 00:09:17,799
Go for it if you're a pro.

196
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:20,518
But, if you don't have much experience,

197
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,769
or if your hair is too simple

198
00:09:23,794 --> 00:09:25,866
or bland,

199
00:09:25,891 --> 00:09:29,245
divide the hair once more.

200
00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:33,949
You can divide the front hair into the part that goes between the eyes

201
00:09:35,222 --> 00:09:37,863
and the two parts next to it.

202
00:09:38,246 --> 00:09:41,135
Just make sure that the middle is wide

203
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,652
and the parts next to it are narrow.

204
00:09:42,894 --> 00:09:44,449
And here's the side hair.

205
00:09:44,613 --> 00:09:48,566
With the back hair, draw in this part.

206
00:09:48,824 --> 00:09:50,681
The reason behind this division is simple.

207
00:09:50,683 --> 00:09:53,027
If someone has long hair,

208
00:09:53,052 --> 00:09:55,566
this hair here would go behind their ears.

209
00:09:55,832 --> 00:09:57,018
So, usually,

210
00:09:57,043 --> 00:09:59,816
the hair here would go right down,

211
00:09:59,926 --> 00:10:03,879
while the hair here has to avoid the air.

212
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:05,921
That's why the hair flow would be different.

213
00:10:06,051 --> 00:10:08,887
So, we would divide a part here,

214
00:10:10,371 --> 00:10:14,472
and you would keep dividing it into more parts

215
00:10:15,051 --> 00:10:17,613
depending on the situation.

216
00:10:17,638 --> 00:10:20,504
Now let's divide it into even smaller parts.

217
00:10:21,586 --> 00:10:22,722
Like this.

218
00:10:25,385 --> 00:10:26,558
And again.

219
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:34,152
It is important to divide it randomly.

220
00:10:34,347 --> 00:10:37,402
If you don't do so intentionally,

221
00:10:37,427 --> 00:10:39,941
you'll end up with hair that is too regular.

222
00:10:40,621 --> 00:10:42,910
This is a common mistake

223
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:44,988
that male artists make.

224
00:10:46,988 --> 00:10:51,793
If you're good at drawing machines,

225
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:55,441
but have difficulty drawing nature, like trees,

226
00:10:55,466 --> 00:10:58,676
you might also come across this mistake

227
00:10:58,701 --> 00:11:00,879
where you'd draw hair too evenly.

228
00:11:00,904 --> 00:11:02,949
So, you should be aware of that.

229
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:07,121
You should intentionally divide hair randomly.

230
00:11:07,146 --> 00:11:08,375
That's important.

231
00:11:09,051 --> 00:11:12,269
So, let's say we're dividing it irregularly.

232
00:11:12,294 --> 00:11:15,519
But is there a shortcut to it?

233
00:11:16,972 --> 00:11:18,629
I'll give you some advice.

234
00:11:18,654 --> 00:11:21,613
Stick a small part to a big part.

235
00:11:23,004 --> 00:11:24,597
For instance, like this.

236
00:11:24,898 --> 00:11:29,371
I'll add a small part, and a big part again.

237
00:11:32,782 --> 00:11:35,557
And then a big part, and a small part.

238
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:38,730
You can take turns with the big part and the small part.

239
00:11:38,755 --> 00:11:41,121
Or, you can just draw a big part in the middle.

240
00:11:41,286 --> 00:11:44,030
You can draw in multiple small parts, too.

241
00:11:44,418 --> 00:11:46,697
So, if you randomly draw these parts,

242
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:49,941
your hair will look much more natural.

243
00:11:50,754 --> 00:11:52,334
Draw a small part next to a big part.

244
00:11:52,335 --> 00:11:54,404
That's what I commonly do.

245
00:11:54,406 --> 00:11:56,887
It's also what I commonly recommend to students.

246
00:11:58,937 --> 00:12:02,387
You would draw in smaller parts like this.

247
00:12:08,074 --> 00:12:10,244
For now, don't focus on the hairstyle.

248
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:11,801
Focus on dividing the hair into smaller parts.

249
00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:14,816
I'll tell you how to draw different hairstyles

250
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:17,426
later on.

251
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:21,707
Make sure the side hair

252
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,512
covers the front hair.

253
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:31,042
A small part, and a big part.

254
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:32,418
Then a small part.

255
00:12:36,295 --> 00:12:37,488
The same goes for long hair, too.

256
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,222
A small part, and then a big part.

257
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,004
Another small part.

258
00:12:45,586 --> 00:12:46,558
And another one.

259
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:48,933
Make sure you take turns with drawing

260
00:12:54,894 --> 00:12:58,276
the big part and the small part.

261
00:12:58,301 --> 00:13:00,199
That's how you would draw hair.

262
00:13:00,987 --> 00:13:03,902
Now that I've drawn in the overall shape,

263
00:13:05,525 --> 00:13:08,713
I'll add the hair strands as well.

264
00:13:08,957 --> 00:13:12,213
I'll give you a tip with hair strands.

265
00:13:12,214 --> 00:13:16,152
Hair strands are basically single hairs sticking out.

266
00:13:16,177 --> 00:13:19,519
So, it's good to know when hair looks irregular.

267
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:22,035
When does that happen?

268
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,402
It happens when it gets blown in the wind.

269
00:13:25,512 --> 00:13:28,113
Actually, it's easier to understand if you think of curtains.

270
00:13:28,138 --> 00:13:30,289
Curtains are somewhat heavy.

271
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:33,088
Hair is also somewhat heavy.

272
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:34,744
So, when the wind blows from underneath,

273
00:13:34,746 --> 00:13:36,571
and if the hair blows naturally,

274
00:13:36,573 --> 00:13:38,381
it won't look like this,

275
00:13:38,691 --> 00:13:41,410
but instead, it will blow in an S shape

276
00:13:44,203 --> 00:13:46,215
like this.

277
00:13:47,418 --> 00:13:49,244
So, when the hair is blowing in the wind,

278
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:51,027
it looks most irregular

279
00:13:52,527 --> 00:13:55,038
in the parts where it curves the most.

280
00:13:55,176 --> 00:13:56,237
I'm referring to the parts

281
00:13:56,262 --> 00:13:57,994
where the hair flow changes.

282
00:13:57,996 --> 00:13:58,730
Here.

283
00:14:00,984 --> 00:14:02,332
This area

284
00:14:03,531 --> 00:14:05,199
and this second area.

285
00:14:06,586 --> 00:14:08,715
There's a third area here, too.

286
00:14:10,699 --> 00:14:14,400
So, be aware of

287
00:14:14,401 --> 00:14:16,793
where the hair flow changes.

288
00:14:16,818 --> 00:14:20,716
So, if you add in hair strands here,

289
00:14:20,718 --> 00:14:24,035
your hair will look quite natural.

290
00:14:24,847 --> 00:14:27,285
So, let's move on.

291
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:32,291
Basically, you'd add in hair strands where the hair flow changes.

292
00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:35,703
Like a twig,

293
00:14:38,588 --> 00:14:41,176
a hair strand could also have additional parts sticking out.

294
00:14:42,785 --> 00:14:43,691
Like this.

295
00:14:44,043 --> 00:14:45,674
Since it could be divided again,

296
00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:48,252
we would add in the details

297
00:14:48,277 --> 00:14:52,668
by adding in hair strands.

298
00:14:52,693 --> 00:14:54,172
Then it would be easier to understand.

299
00:14:54,687 --> 00:14:56,775
As you divide in more parts like this,

300
00:14:56,776 --> 00:14:58,238
it will help you a lot

301
00:14:58,263 --> 00:15:00,222
if you're going for a more mature hairstyle.

302
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:03,104
If a hair is divided into a lot of small parts,

303
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:05,347
a character would look more mature.

304
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,987
But, if you don't divide it a lot,

305
00:15:08,012 --> 00:15:09,597
to make it look dull

306
00:15:09,691 --> 00:15:11,805
by using a lot of big parts,

307
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:13,555
the character looks cuter.

308
00:15:13,902 --> 00:15:16,793
So, I'll draw the character's hair

309
00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:20,683
by utilizing the parts I previously divided.

310
00:15:33,929 --> 00:15:35,659
I mentioned before

311
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:38,187
that deformers are applied to hair.

312
00:15:38,189 --> 00:15:41,406
Because we're just practicing for now,

313
00:15:41,431 --> 00:15:42,605
we would approach it like this.

314
00:15:42,607 --> 00:15:44,181
But, when you're actually drawing,

315
00:15:44,205 --> 00:15:46,562
you should think in advance

316
00:15:47,008 --> 00:15:50,322
your character's personality

317
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,482
and what kind of atmosphere you want to create.

318
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:55,641
Dividing the hair into smaller parts will make your character look mature

319
00:15:55,723 --> 00:15:59,008
and dividing it less will make it look like a child.

320
00:15:59,133 --> 00:16:01,840
You could use this knowledge to your advantage.

321
00:16:01,896 --> 00:16:04,383
Or, the hairstyle itself could change.

322
00:16:04,508 --> 00:16:08,266
If it's a child, you could give it short hair.

323
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:12,539
Or you can give some volume to the hair.

324
00:16:12,609 --> 00:16:14,936
But if it's a more mature character,

325
00:16:14,961 --> 00:16:17,165
you can give it straight, long hair

326
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,617
so that it looks more neat.

327
00:16:20,422 --> 00:16:23,135
Or you can get rid of some hair strands.

328
00:16:25,305 --> 00:16:27,120
Because it will have these changes in design,

329
00:16:27,145 --> 00:16:31,803
you should draw the hair after you've decided

330
00:16:31,828 --> 00:16:34,703
what kind of character you'll draw.

331
00:16:36,126 --> 00:16:37,625
This character will look like this

332
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:40,191
if we use the parts we previously divided

333
00:16:40,193 --> 00:16:41,688
and draw hair on top of that.

334
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:51,008
Now, you can see the overall shape of the hair.

335
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:57,582
Thus, with hair,

336
00:16:57,606 --> 00:17:00,888
it's important to give randomness to hair

337
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:03,390
by dividing it into big and small parts.

338
00:17:03,391 --> 00:17:04,762
It is important to understand hair

339
00:17:04,786 --> 00:17:08,608
as a dimension that covers

340
00:17:08,633 --> 00:17:09,922
the head.

341
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:12,719
Remember these three things.

342
00:17:12,905 --> 00:17:15,225
So, I've mentioned before that you should approach

343
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,500
three-dimensional shapes differently from before.

344
00:17:17,502 --> 00:17:18,752
But actually, that happens when

345
00:17:18,753 --> 00:17:21,680
the head turns around.

346
00:17:22,653 --> 00:17:25,570
I met a lot of students

347
00:17:25,571 --> 00:17:28,039
who made this mistake.

348
00:17:30,031 --> 00:17:31,106
It's a mistake you make

349
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:34,312
when you draw a face in profile.

350
00:17:34,703 --> 00:17:36,366
When you're drawing this type of face,

351
00:17:36,391 --> 00:17:39,233
what happens when you divide a hair into parts?

352
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:43,348
Remember the most important part of the profile was the ear?

353
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,945
Let's say this is the center.

354
00:17:44,986 --> 00:17:46,959
If you draw the hair

355
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:49,100
you won't draw it in just straight lines.

356
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:50,711
You would apply perspective as well.

357
00:17:51,219 --> 00:17:53,530
So, if you add some dimension to it,

358
00:17:53,555 --> 00:17:55,430
it will be curved like this.

359
00:17:56,906 --> 00:17:59,203
Think of placing a mop on top of it.

360
00:17:59,586 --> 00:18:01,120
Then it will look like this.

361
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,320
Perspective would be applied.

362
00:18:03,531 --> 00:18:05,734
Then, the important thing here is

363
00:18:06,823 --> 00:18:10,114
that the side hair tends to go left.

364
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:13,922
You may ask

365
00:18:13,947 --> 00:18:15,020
why this is so confusing.

366
00:18:15,022 --> 00:18:17,918
But, people who put an emphasis on hairstyle

367
00:18:17,942 --> 00:18:19,147
make this kind of mistake.

368
00:18:19,613 --> 00:18:20,875
When you're drawing the front hair,

369
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,800
you'll see that the side hair sticks out

370
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:23,547
like this.

371
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:25,910
The people I've just mentioned tend to

372
00:18:25,934 --> 00:18:27,379
focus on this round silhouette.

373
00:18:28,969 --> 00:18:32,141
So, even when they are drawing a profile,

374
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,414
they might draw hair like this.

375
00:18:38,904 --> 00:18:41,232
There are people who draw the front hair

376
00:18:41,257 --> 00:18:42,443
like this,

377
00:18:42,591 --> 00:18:43,876
with a curl in the hair

378
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,755
to make sure the silhouette stays round.

379
00:18:45,974 --> 00:18:48,271
They make a lot of mistakes in this process.

380
00:18:48,521 --> 00:18:49,621
As I told you,

381
00:18:49,646 --> 00:18:51,841
this side hair

382
00:18:51,974 --> 00:18:54,063
is located on the left

383
00:18:55,294 --> 00:18:57,241
and when they make mistakes,

384
00:18:57,243 --> 00:18:59,130
it means they purposely flipped it.

385
00:18:59,216 --> 00:19:02,138
So, in this stage, they would make mistakes with the dimensions.

386
00:19:02,347 --> 00:19:03,206
To look at this area

387
00:19:03,207 --> 00:19:04,692
clearly,

388
00:19:04,694 --> 00:19:06,700
it is important to consider in advance

389
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:09,583
where the hair should be flowing towards

390
00:19:09,888 --> 00:19:12,300
and how it would float

391
00:19:12,325 --> 00:19:15,841
according to how the face is tilted.

392
00:19:16,177 --> 00:19:18,030
So, let's go through this process accurately

393
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:20,299
and minimize any mistakes we could make.

394
00:19:22,193 --> 00:19:25,816
So, let's just say

395
00:19:25,841 --> 00:19:27,140
that you can draw some simple hair like this.

396
00:19:27,142 --> 00:19:30,477
From here, we'll try more complicated hairstyles,

397
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:33,000
and hairstyles commonly used for casual characters.

398
00:19:33,002 --> 00:19:35,294
So, we'll go over some common patterns with hair.

399
00:19:36,497 --> 00:19:38,540
But, they're just common patterns.

400
00:19:38,565 --> 00:19:39,934
They're not all the patterns.

401
00:19:40,021 --> 00:19:42,622
First of all,

402
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:45,342
there's this pattern.

403
00:19:45,661 --> 00:19:47,285
It's when we lift the side hair

404
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:50,130
in an M shape like this.

405
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,214
You can see this style commonly

406
00:19:56,239 --> 00:19:58,178
with characters in games.

407
00:19:58,646 --> 00:20:00,966
That was the first example.

408
00:20:01,404 --> 00:20:02,630
Now, the second example

409
00:20:03,122 --> 00:20:07,474
would be when the front hair sticks out

410
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:08,825
from the side hair.

411
00:20:09,477 --> 00:20:11,989
In this case, the side hair stays the same.

412
00:20:12,685 --> 00:20:14,392
Only the front hair will stick out

413
00:20:14,394 --> 00:20:17,949
and come out towards the back of the side hair

414
00:20:17,974 --> 00:20:19,411
like this.

415
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:22,680
Because the silhouette will look pointy,

416
00:20:22,682 --> 00:20:24,634
we commonly use this pattern

417
00:20:24,661 --> 00:20:26,326
to draw a more energetic character.

418
00:20:27,044 --> 00:20:31,427
Next, we have the sideburns going inwards.

419
00:20:33,326 --> 00:20:35,443
For this, you would draw the side hair

420
00:20:35,994 --> 00:20:38,485
as inward as possible, like this.

421
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:41,169
So, what effect would this give?

422
00:20:41,171 --> 00:20:45,568
If the hair covers the profile a lot,

423
00:20:45,607 --> 00:20:48,698
the face would look very narrow.

424
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,583
So, when you're drawing a face,

425
00:20:51,608 --> 00:20:54,450
you might draw it like that.

426
00:20:54,913 --> 00:20:56,864
If you draw hair

427
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,210
right after you draw the head,

428
00:21:03,755 --> 00:21:05,511
or if you cover the hair

429
00:21:05,536 --> 00:21:07,974
after just drawing the head this much,

430
00:21:08,357 --> 00:21:11,400
when you delete this area as you color the hair,

431
00:21:11,402 --> 00:21:13,146
you may find yourself

432
00:21:14,013 --> 00:21:15,934
with a face

433
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:18,120
that's really wide and flat.

434
00:21:18,121 --> 00:21:20,660
Most of the time, in this case,

435
00:21:20,685 --> 00:21:23,506
the side hair would have covered the face.

436
00:21:23,614 --> 00:21:26,455
Remember when you take a photo or a selfie

437
00:21:26,456 --> 00:21:28,120
you would usually cover your face with hair

438
00:21:28,145 --> 00:21:31,200
so that it would look small?

439
00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:33,872
In real life, people with a wide face

440
00:21:33,897 --> 00:21:35,839
tend to cover it with their side hair

441
00:21:35,841 --> 00:21:38,904
when they're going for a new hairstyle.

442
00:21:39,107 --> 00:21:40,983
That would mean

443
00:21:40,985 --> 00:21:44,071
the side hair covers up the face a lot.

444
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:46,963
So, if you curl it inwards,

445
00:21:46,965 --> 00:21:50,224
the character's face would look small.

446
00:21:50,388 --> 00:21:53,108
That was the third most common hairstyle.

447
00:21:54,073 --> 00:21:56,058
If we add one more example,

448
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,058
there's the hair antennae, which is used often.

449
00:21:58,864 --> 00:22:01,232
Even with hair antennae, there are a lot of types.

450
00:22:01,257 --> 00:22:02,680
A really big hair antenna,

451
00:22:02,682 --> 00:22:03,957
a regular antenna,

452
00:22:03,982 --> 00:22:05,949
two antennae,

453
00:22:05,974 --> 00:22:07,833
all of these antennae

454
00:22:08,404 --> 00:22:10,147
are also referred to as 'ahoge' hair.

455
00:22:10,172 --> 00:22:12,638
You can apply hair like this.

456
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,707
Here also, the hair sticking out

457
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,727
can also be applied to the back hair.

458
00:22:17,729 --> 00:22:19,178
Now, the important thing is

459
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:22,825
if the hair length is too random,

460
00:22:23,443 --> 00:22:25,396
the hairstyle could look awkward.

461
00:22:25,896 --> 00:22:27,160
So, if possible,

462
00:22:27,185 --> 00:22:28,724
if you're going to draw

463
00:22:28,726 --> 00:22:31,904
some hair sticking out from this part,

464
00:22:31,929 --> 00:22:33,521
make sure it goes down a bit

465
00:22:35,177 --> 00:22:36,942
and also make sure

466
00:22:36,944 --> 00:22:40,224
that the length isn't too random.

467
00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:41,843
What do we call this?

468
00:22:41,845 --> 00:22:44,443
It's hair with a wrong trim.

469
00:22:44,982 --> 00:22:46,425
In other words, it's really messed up hair.

470
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:47,943
As you can see from these expressions,

471
00:22:47,968 --> 00:22:49,911
it isn't a good looking hairstyle.

472
00:22:50,025 --> 00:22:52,111
Be careful when you're drawing.

473
00:22:52,113 --> 00:22:53,072
So far, we looked over

474
00:22:53,096 --> 00:22:56,489
some common hairstyles used for casual characters.

475
00:22:56,646 --> 00:22:59,130
So, we should now look at

476
00:22:59,155 --> 00:23:00,879
hairstyles in real life

477
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,764
such as permed hair.

478
00:23:02,765 --> 00:23:05,425
One thing you should remember is

479
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,763
that hair is actually dimensional.

480
00:23:07,764 --> 00:23:09,377
Remembering this is very important

481
00:23:09,379 --> 00:23:11,857
because when wind blows into the hair

482
00:23:12,193 --> 00:23:14,294
that makes a huge impact in the end.

483
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:18,660
When wind blows into the hair,

484
00:23:18,685 --> 00:23:21,234
the hair would blow like this.

485
00:23:21,654 --> 00:23:22,767
If you see here,

486
00:23:22,791 --> 00:23:25,802
the part above here won't easily blow.

487
00:23:26,435 --> 00:23:30,029
If we cover a sphere with a cloth

488
00:23:30,185 --> 00:23:31,505
like this,

489
00:23:31,601 --> 00:23:34,192
and if the wind blows here,

490
00:23:34,194 --> 00:23:35,839
only this part will go up.

491
00:23:37,286 --> 00:23:38,224
Just like this

492
00:23:40,456 --> 00:23:42,216
in the example.

493
00:23:44,739 --> 00:23:46,400
So, likewise,

494
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:49,716
the upper part won't budge easily.

495
00:23:51,384 --> 00:23:53,091
Well, there are other factors that apply as well.

496
00:23:53,092 --> 00:23:55,558
Just remember that the above part

497
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:56,763
doesn't easily get blown.

498
00:23:56,788 --> 00:23:59,755
Then, the back hair will blow like this.

499
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:03,349
But, if it blows while maintaining its form,

500
00:24:03,485 --> 00:24:05,980
it would look like a lump, not a dimension.

501
00:24:06,005 --> 00:24:08,388
It would look like a lump in a cylinder shape.

502
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,915
So, how would you

503
00:24:09,939 --> 00:24:11,638
show exactly that this is a dimension?

504
00:24:11,663 --> 00:24:14,089
Of course, as you're coloring,

505
00:24:14,114 --> 00:24:16,425
and describing the three-dimensional parts,

506
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:18,457
you can express it that way

507
00:24:18,459 --> 00:24:21,739
but the most effective way is to flip it over.

508
00:24:26,077 --> 00:24:28,829
When you draw hair, you'll usually get stuck here -

509
00:24:28,831 --> 00:24:30,997
when you're flipping it over.

510
00:24:34,747 --> 00:24:36,107
Remember this part that looks irregular

511
00:24:36,109 --> 00:24:39,375
as you flip the hair?

512
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,693
I used this part that looks irregular

513
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:45,818
and split this bit

514
00:24:45,843 --> 00:24:47,279
into two shapes, like this.

515
00:24:47,763 --> 00:24:49,614
Add one more, and now there's three.

516
00:24:50,044 --> 00:24:52,233
Like this, add some irregularity to it.

517
00:24:52,235 --> 00:24:55,091
If there is a big part, add in a small part.

518
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:59,216
Then, you can make the hair more detailed.

519
00:24:59,411 --> 00:25:02,379
If you draw in more parts where they flip over,

520
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:05,825
the hair will look three-dimensional.

521
00:25:06,029 --> 00:25:08,294
So, the viewer can also

522
00:25:08,296 --> 00:25:10,200
understand the hair's form a bit better.

523
00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:12,595
That's why, before applying the hair style,

524
00:25:12,597 --> 00:25:15,854
you need to practice flipping the hair.

525
00:25:15,856 --> 00:25:18,976
If this is too difficult,

526
00:25:18,978 --> 00:25:20,940
start practicing with a simple dimension.

527
00:25:31,246 --> 00:25:32,411
Like this.

528
00:25:32,796 --> 00:25:34,841
Or, think of it as a ribbon.

529
00:25:35,443 --> 00:25:38,529
Practice drawing the twisted sides.

530
00:25:38,531 --> 00:25:41,364
And, make it move irregularly.

531
00:25:42,911 --> 00:25:44,879
Make the ends sharp

532
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,509
so that it looks like hair.

533
00:25:47,583 --> 00:25:48,872
Try this when you practice.

534
00:25:48,897 --> 00:25:50,808
Once you're done,

535
00:25:50,833 --> 00:25:52,755
we'll apply a wave here.

536
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,656
A wave is literally when

537
00:25:54,658 --> 00:25:57,674
this hair is all curled up.

538
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,872
Even with waves, there are many different types.

539
00:26:00,897 --> 00:26:02,435
If there's too much of it,

540
00:26:02,591 --> 00:26:04,654
it would curl up like this

541
00:26:04,656 --> 00:26:07,544
and the hair would be all twisted

542
00:26:09,091 --> 00:26:10,286
like this

543
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:14,161
like fusilli pasta.

544
00:26:17,318 --> 00:26:19,614
If you have a big hair part like this,

545
00:26:19,639 --> 00:26:22,380
you'll add irregularity by adding in small parts.

546
00:26:23,536 --> 00:26:25,269
This part is curved forwards.

547
00:26:25,294 --> 00:26:27,661
Add some irregularity to it.

548
00:26:28,272 --> 00:26:29,435
The direction changes here.

549
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:33,643
Decide whether or not you want to add irregularity.

550
00:26:34,425 --> 00:26:35,786
It's not really necessary.

551
00:26:36,185 --> 00:26:39,630
But, if you repeat adding it in and not adding it in,

552
00:26:40,302 --> 00:26:43,224
the hair will look quite natural.

553
00:26:43,499 --> 00:26:46,418
You could draw a curled up hair like this,

554
00:26:46,495 --> 00:26:48,186
or you can draw a waved hair or a permed hair.

555
00:26:48,187 --> 00:26:50,582
I'll show you an example of a slightly permed hair.

556
00:26:50,607 --> 00:26:52,308
But first, I'll leave this here.

557
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:57,708
Flip a large dimension

558
00:26:57,985 --> 00:26:58,973
and start drawing, but

559
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:01,287
you can tell that the dimension itself gets thick

560
00:27:01,312 --> 00:27:03,722
if it is waved like this.

561
00:27:05,632 --> 00:27:08,341
Think of a thick object

562
00:27:09,138 --> 00:27:10,950
and flip it over.

563
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,480
This one here is a dimension, too.

564
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:16,313
This fact shouldn't change.

565
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:18,244
But, this dimension does change its shape.

566
00:27:18,245 --> 00:27:19,716
It changes its shape with a ponytail.

567
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:23,068
Because the hair is clustered, we can't really say it's a dimension.

568
00:27:23,286 --> 00:27:26,034
So, there's the lump up to here.

569
00:27:26,036 --> 00:27:28,190
And the dimension starts as the lump starts to divide itself.

570
00:27:28,192 --> 00:27:30,591
You'll understand it better this way.

571
00:27:33,622 --> 00:27:35,006
When you're drawing waved or permed hair,

572
00:27:35,008 --> 00:27:36,907
you should make sure that the hair has volume.

573
00:27:36,908 --> 00:27:38,773
It is really important to

574
00:27:38,774 --> 00:27:41,849
make sure that the hair goes outwards

575
00:27:43,006 --> 00:27:44,927
and that the silhouette has some irregularity.

576
00:27:48,005 --> 00:27:50,293
Let's experiment with it a lot

577
00:27:50,318 --> 00:27:52,411
and approach drawing different hairstyles.

578
00:27:52,911 --> 00:27:55,568
Now, let's look at this male character's face.

579
00:27:55,593 --> 00:27:58,371
Some of you may think that a male character's hairstyle

580
00:27:58,396 --> 00:28:00,843
is harder to approach than a female character's hairstyle.

581
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:01,994
Why does that happen?

582
00:28:01,995 --> 00:28:04,404
Generally, a male character has short hair.

583
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,155
Of course, not all of them have short hair.

584
00:28:06,157 --> 00:28:08,631
But when we are drawing short hair,

585
00:28:08,633 --> 00:28:11,297
dividing the hair into smaller parts

586
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:12,974
is more challenging.

587
00:28:13,138 --> 00:28:15,997
Dividing it into big parts is the same.

588
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,519
With short hair, too,

589
00:28:18,544 --> 00:28:19,728
we would divide it into the front hair,

590
00:28:19,752 --> 00:28:22,068
the side hair, and the back hair.

591
00:28:25,194 --> 00:28:27,599
I'll keep it short since I'm drawing short hair.

592
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,646
Dividing it into big parts is the same.

593
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:39,294
But, after that, it becomes a bit complicated.

594
00:28:41,085 --> 00:28:42,724
Why is it complicated?

595
00:28:44,193 --> 00:28:46,138
When I was dividing it,

596
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:48,758
see how I connected them with a same line?

597
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,779
When we look at hair from the side,

598
00:28:53,825 --> 00:28:55,738
our hair

599
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,271
doesn't just have this part

600
00:28:57,296 --> 00:28:59,208
and nothing underneath.

601
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,082
If there's nothing underneath, when we jump,

602
00:29:01,107 --> 00:29:02,880
this hair would fly like this

603
00:29:03,215 --> 00:29:04,630
and there would be no hair in this area.

604
00:29:05,849 --> 00:29:07,607
So, how does our hair actually look?

605
00:29:07,632 --> 00:29:09,414
In real life, with hair,

606
00:29:09,591 --> 00:29:12,036
if there's hair at the top, there's hair underneath it.

607
00:29:12,161 --> 00:29:13,106
There's some more hair underneath that,

608
00:29:13,108 --> 00:29:14,089
and some more underneath.

609
00:29:14,091 --> 00:29:15,654
Like this.

610
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,021
In other words, it's layered.

611
00:29:17,663 --> 00:29:20,357
With female characters, this is not that evident.

612
00:29:20,382 --> 00:29:22,163
Because if we have the upper hair,

613
00:29:22,188 --> 00:29:23,567
it covers everything up,

614
00:29:23,591 --> 00:29:25,107
so we can't see the hair underneath it.

615
00:29:25,219 --> 00:29:26,091
Because it is long.

616
00:29:26,185 --> 00:29:29,222
But, with male characters, if they have short hair,

617
00:29:29,224 --> 00:29:31,454
the hair underneath it can be seen.

618
00:29:31,456 --> 00:29:32,708
This also happens with female characters with short hair.

619
00:29:32,733 --> 00:29:36,099
Because the hair underneath can be seen,

620
00:29:37,544 --> 00:29:40,674
we draw it as if it's layered.

621
00:29:40,676 --> 00:29:43,286
So, as you divide it into big and small parts,

622
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:51,503
you need to make sure to layer them.

623
00:29:53,508 --> 00:29:54,682
A big part

624
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,002
then a small part,

625
00:29:57,089 --> 00:29:58,366
a small part,

626
00:29:58,612 --> 00:29:59,809
then a big part.

627
00:29:59,891 --> 00:30:01,230
Draw them alternately.

628
00:30:04,818 --> 00:30:05,925
Draw in a small part.

629
00:30:07,114 --> 00:30:10,167
Draw some more small parts

630
00:30:10,192 --> 00:30:11,573
because it has short hair.

631
00:30:14,995 --> 00:30:17,190
Make sure it looks like

632
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:19,029
there are more parts added in irregularly.

633
00:30:21,807 --> 00:30:23,155
Like I did previously,

634
00:30:23,179 --> 00:30:25,076
I'll add hair to this.

635
00:30:28,341 --> 00:30:29,628
Before I begin,

636
00:30:32,518 --> 00:30:34,151
I'll have to divide these parts again.

637
00:30:34,176 --> 00:30:35,526
A small part,

638
00:30:36,855 --> 00:30:37,870
then a big part,

639
00:30:40,802 --> 00:30:42,682
a big part, then a small part.

640
00:30:43,596 --> 00:30:45,081
Draw in some more hair here.

641
00:30:45,186 --> 00:30:47,003
A small part, then a big part.

642
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,425
Another small part here.

643
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:58,788
Draw in additional parts

644
00:30:58,812 --> 00:31:00,943
and make sure they look irregular.

645
00:31:01,214 --> 00:31:02,181
A small part,

646
00:31:02,206 --> 00:31:03,120
then a big part.

647
00:31:03,145 --> 00:31:05,811
Then, you can add

648
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:08,040
irregularity to it.

649
00:31:08,042 --> 00:31:10,409
Then, the hair won't look unnatural

650
00:31:10,434 --> 00:31:11,651
and it won't look stiff.

651
00:31:11,676 --> 00:31:14,284
That can be avoided,

652
00:31:15,268 --> 00:31:18,596
and you'll be able to draw natural-looking hair.

653
00:31:18,893 --> 00:31:21,534
So, most people who find it difficult to draw hair say that

654
00:31:21,536 --> 00:31:23,374
they have trouble with the parts

655
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:24,898
that are too regular.

656
00:31:24,923 --> 00:31:26,620
There are also people

657
00:31:26,621 --> 00:31:28,714
who draw hair too regularly

658
00:31:29,135 --> 00:31:30,806
without realizing it until the end.

659
00:31:30,831 --> 00:31:34,213
So, make sure you check after you draw everything.

660
00:31:34,215 --> 00:31:36,789
It is really important to check

661
00:31:36,791 --> 00:31:39,314
if the hair has little to no irregularity.

662
00:31:39,316 --> 00:31:41,284
I call this self-feedback.

663
00:31:41,382 --> 00:31:44,689
You should give yourself feedback in your work process

664
00:31:44,714 --> 00:31:46,743
whether you're drawing a human body

665
00:31:46,745 --> 00:31:48,721
or an illustration whenever possible.

666
00:31:49,331 --> 00:31:51,198
People usually don't do this if they aren't told to.

667
00:31:51,307 --> 00:31:53,338
People usually do this

668
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,518
a long time after they've finished a drawing.

669
00:31:55,737 --> 00:31:57,952
At that point, they'll feel

670
00:31:58,182 --> 00:31:59,900
as if they didn't do a good job on it.

671
00:31:59,902 --> 00:32:03,821
Or, right before completion, you may think your drawing looks terrible.

672
00:32:03,822 --> 00:32:05,206
So you might not want to finish it.

673
00:32:06,296 --> 00:32:07,793
To prevent this from happening,

674
00:32:07,818 --> 00:32:13,198
it is very important to

675
00:32:13,901 --> 00:32:16,214
do self-feedback as you're drawing.

676
00:32:16,925 --> 00:32:19,579
In that process, make sure

677
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,706
that your hair has enough regularity and irregularity

678
00:32:22,948 --> 00:32:23,962
and that they are used alternately.

679
00:32:23,987 --> 00:32:25,741
So, I'll draw this male character's hair

680
00:32:25,765 --> 00:32:27,784
by drawing many layers in it.

681
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:33,151
It looks complicated, doesn't it?

682
00:32:33,401 --> 00:32:35,940
So, when you're drawing natural-looking hair,

683
00:32:35,973 --> 00:32:38,616
I think that it is more difficult to

684
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,034
draw a male character's hair.

685
00:32:43,315 --> 00:32:46,104
But, if you color this layered hair well,

686
00:32:46,129 --> 00:32:48,221
it will look really natural

687
00:32:49,603 --> 00:32:51,753
and it will look more aesthetic.

688
00:32:52,884 --> 00:32:55,513
That doesn't mean long hair isn't aesthetic.

689
00:32:56,323 --> 00:32:59,877
We approach it with the same method when we perm a male character's hair.

690
00:32:59,902 --> 00:33:02,143
We approach it in the same way,

691
00:33:05,907 --> 00:33:08,526
but we can't quite flip the hair since it's short.

692
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,600
It will be difficult to

693
00:33:11,601 --> 00:33:12,753
flip it more than twice.

694
00:33:12,754 --> 00:33:14,831
Even when you're flipping it, flip it just once.

695
00:33:17,546 --> 00:33:19,214
An upper side, and an underside.

696
00:33:20,831 --> 00:33:23,290
So the part that bends once becomes twice or

697
00:33:24,453 --> 00:33:26,387
the part that went backwards goes forwards

698
00:33:26,906 --> 00:33:28,800
and vice versa.

699
00:33:30,211 --> 00:33:32,307
So make some changes

700
00:33:32,795 --> 00:33:34,792
to add perm to the hair.

701
00:33:36,001 --> 00:33:37,237
Twist it around.

702
00:33:54,784 --> 00:33:57,295
This is how you should approach

703
00:33:57,319 --> 00:33:59,166
a character's hairstyle.

704
00:33:59,191 --> 00:34:00,255
One more thing.

705
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,619
Let's also learn how to draw hair blowing in the wind.

706
00:34:03,644 --> 00:34:06,675
Like I mentioned before, hair blowing in the wind

707
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:10,844
would make an S shape and blow around.

708
00:34:10,846 --> 00:34:12,012
Again, here,

709
00:34:12,014 --> 00:34:15,916
there are parts with irregularity.

710
00:34:17,713 --> 00:34:22,799
If a big part flows like this,

711
00:34:24,252 --> 00:34:27,373
we would add in smaller parts,

712
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:30,557
then we would flip the hair

713
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:39,643
and there would be irregularity because the hair flow would change too.

714
00:34:39,668 --> 00:34:42,518
There's always irregularity to parts where the flow changes.

715
00:34:43,841 --> 00:34:47,799
Add in hair strands, too.

716
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,002
Small and big ones.

717
00:34:59,041 --> 00:35:00,682
Approach the front hair in the same way.

718
00:35:01,041 --> 00:35:02,479
Small part, then a big part.

719
00:35:03,088 --> 00:35:05,104
Small, small and big.

720
00:35:08,824 --> 00:35:10,104
Flip it over,

721
00:35:10,899 --> 00:35:12,315
and add irregularity.

722
00:35:14,096 --> 00:35:16,580
Once you are familiar with it,

723
00:35:16,764 --> 00:35:18,573
draw them alternately.

724
00:35:18,598 --> 00:35:23,252
If you do this a lot, it will be detailed and the character will look mature.

725
00:35:23,596 --> 00:35:26,155
But if you don't do this a lot,

726
00:35:26,179 --> 00:35:28,347
it will be a more casual style character.

727
00:35:28,349 --> 00:35:30,585
So, you can decide how much you'll do this depending on

728
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:32,416
your drawing style and your character's personality.

729
00:35:45,515 --> 00:35:47,889
You may ask why I'm emphasizing this.

730
00:35:47,891 --> 00:35:49,726
How much would a character's atmosphere change

731
00:35:51,101 --> 00:35:52,820
depending on how much the hair is deformed?

732
00:35:53,134 --> 00:35:54,570
Well, there's a big difference!

733
00:35:55,031 --> 00:35:59,027
Even if the wind is blowing in the same way,

734
00:35:59,029 --> 00:36:01,140
this detailed hair above

735
00:36:08,524 --> 00:36:11,398
and this less detailed hair below,

736
00:36:14,197 --> 00:36:16,999
you can see that they each give off

737
00:36:23,046 --> 00:36:24,406
different atmospheres.

738
00:36:24,408 --> 00:36:26,710
I'm not trying to say that the one on the bottom has less detail.

739
00:36:32,309 --> 00:36:34,736
See how they have a different feeling?

740
00:36:34,738 --> 00:36:38,518
With the amount of hair strands, think of the mood you want to create,

741
00:36:38,543 --> 00:36:41,111
and add in the amount you want.

742
00:36:42,279 --> 00:36:44,901
Now, we're done with studying hair for now.

743
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:48,088
To sum up... With hair, you need to divide it into big and small parts

744
00:36:48,113 --> 00:36:50,992
to add irregularity.

745
00:36:51,401 --> 00:36:53,709
And, if you want to focus on the volume as well,

746
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:59,314
note that the hair itself is a dimension.

747
00:36:59,316 --> 00:37:03,080
Make sure the hair covers the head,

748
00:37:03,197 --> 00:37:06,518
then, you can draw natural looking hair.

749
00:37:06,916 --> 00:37:10,086
And, remember the parts that add irregularity to the hair

750
00:37:10,111 --> 00:37:12,815
and the hair designs commonly used for casual style characters.

751
00:37:15,065 --> 00:37:17,876
When the hair blows in the wind,

752
00:37:17,878 --> 00:37:19,443
flip it over

753
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:21,127
to give it irregular elements.

754
00:37:21,557 --> 00:37:23,711
If you focus on that,

755
00:37:23,712 --> 00:37:25,299
you can successfully draw

756
00:37:25,301 --> 00:37:28,488
a charming hairstyle.

757
00:37:28,513 --> 00:37:31,700
Of course, there are numerous hairstyles in real life.

758
00:37:31,725 --> 00:37:36,110
To practice drawing them, it's best to use photo references.

759
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,550
There are hairstyles that actually exist,

760
00:37:38,552 --> 00:37:39,975
but there are also hairstyles

761
00:37:39,977 --> 00:37:42,383
that only exist in illustrations.

762
00:37:42,408 --> 00:37:44,174
Analyzing them can be a fun exercise.

763
00:37:44,315 --> 00:37:45,290
But, when you're analyzing them,

764
00:37:45,292 --> 00:37:49,197
make sure you divide the hair

765
00:37:49,244 --> 00:37:50,899
into the side, back and front parts.

766
00:37:50,924 --> 00:37:53,079
If you do that,

767
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,104
you'll be able to analyze it more efficiently.

768
00:37:55,424 --> 00:37:58,401
So, that was what I wanted to emphasize.

769
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,802
Now that we've looked at hair,

770
00:38:01,804 --> 00:38:03,123
let's move on.

771
00:38:04,695 --> 00:38:08,791
We are now going to look at how to do clothing creases or folds.

772
00:38:10,135 --> 00:38:12,580
This is also a subject

773
00:38:12,605 --> 00:38:14,682
that many students find difficult.

774
00:38:15,205 --> 00:38:17,213
It would be better to go in detail,

775
00:38:17,238 --> 00:38:20,235
but this class will just focus on the basics.

776
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:24,581
Because this class focuses more on the actual drawing part,

777
00:38:24,583 --> 00:38:27,799
I'll just go over it simply.

778
00:38:27,986 --> 00:38:31,797
In fact, Section 2 is all about how you can practice on your own.

779
00:38:31,799 --> 00:38:34,908
I'll tell you how to do clothing folds and creases.

780
00:38:35,924 --> 00:38:37,448
For those of you

781
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:39,313
who think it's too difficult

782
00:38:39,338 --> 00:38:41,090
that even if you want to study it,

783
00:38:41,092 --> 00:38:42,926
you wouldn't know where to start,

784
00:38:42,928 --> 00:38:44,354
and you have difficulties

785
00:38:44,379 --> 00:38:46,299
with photo references,

786
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,782
I would like to recommend that

787
00:38:47,807 --> 00:38:50,204
although it's okay to sketch with lines,

788
00:38:50,206 --> 00:38:52,449
it's best to study with dimensions.

789
00:38:52,451 --> 00:38:53,244
But why?

790
00:38:53,269 --> 00:38:54,815
What exactly are creases on clothes?

791
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,307
Basically, you would think

792
00:38:56,549 --> 00:38:58,945
that they are folds in the clothing.

793
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,080
But, you should note that

794
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:03,408
even the half-folded parts are creases, too.

795
00:39:04,088 --> 00:39:05,455
What does that mean?

796
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,162
Because these creases

797
00:39:08,187 --> 00:39:09,978
aren't really just lines.

798
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,760
See how it's shaded?

799
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:15,446
This part becomes dark

800
00:39:15,471 --> 00:39:18,041
because

801
00:39:18,526 --> 00:39:19,946
when we separate it into different dimensions,

802
00:39:19,948 --> 00:39:22,493
this front area receives a lot of light.

803
00:39:22,506 --> 00:39:26,359
On the other hand, these two dimensions receive less light

804
00:39:26,373 --> 00:39:27,908
because they're on the side.

805
00:39:28,322 --> 00:39:30,298
So, with creases, they are very three-dimensional,

806
00:39:30,299 --> 00:39:33,315
and have a lot to do with light and shade.

807
00:39:33,963 --> 00:39:35,665
So, when you're drawing creases,

808
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:37,529
don't draw them as lines,

809
00:39:37,531 --> 00:39:40,157
but as dimensions instead.

810
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:41,432
It would be much more effective.

811
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:43,848
So, if you want to practice creases,

812
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:46,329
I advise you to draw with dimensions.

813
00:39:46,354 --> 00:39:48,157
But, before that,

814
00:39:48,182 --> 00:39:51,299
if you want to dive deep into this subject,

815
00:39:51,301 --> 00:39:54,018
you need to know a few rules.

816
00:39:54,236 --> 00:39:57,393
First, find the center of gravity.

817
00:40:01,557 --> 00:40:03,815
Some people call it the centerpoint.

818
00:40:03,817 --> 00:40:06,867
There are a lot of names for this,

819
00:40:06,869 --> 00:40:08,384
but it just means

820
00:40:08,386 --> 00:40:10,821
the part where the clothes are hanging.

821
00:40:11,924 --> 00:40:15,783
Let's say we're grabbing a cloth with both hands

822
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:18,063
and make it hang down like this.

823
00:40:18,065 --> 00:40:19,635
Then, how would the creases look like?

824
00:40:20,213 --> 00:40:22,258
There would be creases that go downwards

825
00:40:22,283 --> 00:40:25,244
with these two circles as the center.

826
00:40:28,611 --> 00:40:31,552
In this case, these two centers

827
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,709
would be

828
00:40:33,711 --> 00:40:35,260
the center of gravity.

829
00:40:35,285 --> 00:40:39,041
So, you need to know where it's exactly located.

830
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,586
Of course, in real life, there are multiple centers.

831
00:40:41,611 --> 00:40:43,699
If we say the clothes hang at the center of gravity,

832
00:40:43,701 --> 00:40:45,234
we can pinpoint it a lot.

833
00:40:45,259 --> 00:40:46,627
But, let's just pinpoint the important ones.

834
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:48,814
The ones where we can clearly see the cloth folding.

835
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:50,604
The cloth around the shoulder would be pulled.

836
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:52,611
See how the arm is folded?

837
00:40:52,636 --> 00:40:54,123
The hand goes behind the back.

838
00:40:54,147 --> 00:40:55,799
This part would be folded a lot.

839
00:40:55,801 --> 00:40:56,963
I'll draw a dot here.

840
00:40:58,096 --> 00:41:01,323
If the wrist has some thickness to it, like this,

841
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:04,018
see how the arm moves inwards?

842
00:41:04,377 --> 00:41:07,135
So, here, we would have another center of gravity.

843
00:41:07,161 --> 00:41:08,299
Right here.

844
00:41:08,901 --> 00:41:11,942
So, the center of gravity here would be at the shoulder,

845
00:41:11,944 --> 00:41:13,385
at the elbow,

846
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:16,721
and at the wrist.

847
00:41:16,723 --> 00:41:20,279
In total, there are three of them.

848
00:41:20,942 --> 00:41:23,415
Second, you need to know

849
00:41:24,134 --> 00:41:25,289
the direction of force.

850
00:41:29,273 --> 00:41:35,518
Creases on clothes go in many different directions.

851
00:41:35,543 --> 00:41:37,062
So, they have a lot of irregularity.

852
00:41:37,087 --> 00:41:41,697
Also, the creases depend on the previous pose the person was taking

853
00:41:41,722 --> 00:41:43,541
when you're looking at the picture.

854
00:41:43,861 --> 00:41:47,510
You should know whether the model pulled their arms in

855
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:50,604
or whether they put their arms out.

856
00:41:50,776 --> 00:41:54,065
Also, the clothes could have been folded after being neat and tidy.

857
00:41:54,236 --> 00:41:57,190
Or, they could have been wrinkled even more.

858
00:41:57,299 --> 00:41:59,682
So, there are many scenarios.

859
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:03,026
But, you should definitely know the direction of the force.

860
00:42:03,111 --> 00:42:07,000
You should know where the creases are headed

861
00:42:07,002 --> 00:42:08,494
if you want to draw them well.

862
00:42:08,845 --> 00:42:11,385
If you see this closely, the creases give us some information.

863
00:42:11,504 --> 00:42:14,377
I told you before that this arm is folded.

864
00:42:14,494 --> 00:42:16,657
If you do the same pose as this picture,

865
00:42:16,682 --> 00:42:19,065
you'll see that your arm moves inwards.

866
00:42:20,213 --> 00:42:23,338
Your arm will move towards your waist.

867
00:42:23,533 --> 00:42:26,369
So, the creases around this area

868
00:42:26,526 --> 00:42:28,549
will be pulled like this.

869
00:42:29,236 --> 00:42:32,053
They will move in the same direction as the arrows.

870
00:42:32,268 --> 00:42:35,213
Let's say I move my arms outwards like this.

871
00:42:35,611 --> 00:42:37,119
So, how would the creases move?

872
00:42:37,144 --> 00:42:38,330
It would move in the opposite direction

873
00:42:38,627 --> 00:42:40,221
like this.

874
00:42:40,643 --> 00:42:42,601
You need to know this because

875
00:42:42,603 --> 00:42:45,174
people who didn't study theory

876
00:42:45,315 --> 00:42:47,604
tend to draw creases around the shoulder

877
00:42:48,635 --> 00:42:50,468
like this.

878
00:42:50,493 --> 00:42:52,048
There are people who draw like this

879
00:42:52,049 --> 00:42:53,532
because of the illustrations they've seen so far.

880
00:42:53,557 --> 00:42:56,086
These creases are formed when the hem is short, but,

881
00:42:56,158 --> 00:42:57,986
another reason behind it is

882
00:42:57,988 --> 00:42:59,963
the arm moving outwards.

883
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,729
If it goes inwards,

884
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:06,189
like the creases here,

885
00:43:06,191 --> 00:43:08,502
these creases should also be going inwards.

886
00:43:10,643 --> 00:43:13,190
So, check the direction of force and see if it's going outwards,

887
00:43:13,192 --> 00:43:14,249
if it's going inwards,

888
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:15,732
or if it goes up and down.

889
00:43:15,734 --> 00:43:17,932
The direction of the creases change depending on that.

890
00:43:18,197 --> 00:43:20,807
Please remember that.

891
00:43:23,077 --> 00:43:25,158
So, now we know the direction of force,

892
00:43:27,499 --> 00:43:30,299
and the center of gravity.

893
00:43:35,588 --> 00:43:37,065
We now know the direction of force,

894
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:39,830
and the center of gravity

895
00:43:39,855 --> 00:43:41,455
where the clothes are folded.

896
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,669
The third most important thing is how the crease itself looks.

897
00:43:44,671 --> 00:43:46,908
Most creases

898
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:50,225
are in a Y shape

899
00:43:50,227 --> 00:43:53,674
or in an X shape.

900
00:43:54,736 --> 00:43:57,478
Let's take a closer look

901
00:43:57,830 --> 00:43:59,424
at the creases of this shirt.

902
00:43:59,674 --> 00:44:01,338
If you look at them,

903
00:44:01,363 --> 00:44:03,385
you'll see that they look like this.

904
00:44:05,752 --> 00:44:09,316
See that the creases have alternating

905
00:44:09,317 --> 00:44:13,123
Y shapes and X shapes?

906
00:44:14,322 --> 00:44:17,580
Most creases will be in a Y shape.

907
00:44:18,393 --> 00:44:20,690
These creases will split out from here

908
00:44:20,715 --> 00:44:23,090
just like a tree branch.

909
00:44:23,115 --> 00:44:24,901
Like this.

910
00:44:25,111 --> 00:44:27,471
Now, the important thing is,

911
00:44:27,496 --> 00:44:29,174
I'm not looking at here,

912
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:30,479
where the crease goes inwards.

913
00:44:30,873 --> 00:44:34,700
Remember when I said to approach the creases as a dimension?

914
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:38,205
There's more I want to tell you.

915
00:44:38,403 --> 00:44:41,211
When we approach creases as lines,

916
00:44:41,236 --> 00:44:43,283
we draw the dark areas like this.

917
00:44:44,194 --> 00:44:47,010
This is why we can't see the shape of the creases.

918
00:44:49,099 --> 00:44:51,461
The part where it looks the most regular

919
00:44:51,486 --> 00:44:52,729
is this part right here.

920
00:44:53,111 --> 00:44:55,574
These areas where the creases stick out

921
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,557
are the most influenced by

922
00:44:57,582 --> 00:44:59,908
the direction of force that I mentioned.

923
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:02,639
So, we should use this

924
00:45:02,664 --> 00:45:04,979
to analyze the creases.

925
00:45:05,166 --> 00:45:06,271
You need to be able to analyze the creases

926
00:45:06,295 --> 00:45:07,682
by looking at the parts that stick out.

927
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:10,317
So, take your time

928
00:45:10,342 --> 00:45:12,065
while analyzing photo references

929
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:14,735
and closely look at where the creases stick out.

930
00:45:15,167 --> 00:45:16,986
Then, you'll see that

931
00:45:17,306 --> 00:45:19,604
the creases have similar shapes.

932
00:45:20,721 --> 00:45:22,601
Once you've familiarized yourself with these shapes,

933
00:45:22,626 --> 00:45:24,083
you'll know that

934
00:45:24,108 --> 00:45:25,924
you now have a better understanding of creases.

935
00:45:29,924 --> 00:45:31,538
So, I've told you

936
00:45:31,563 --> 00:45:33,545
the three key points of creases.

937
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:35,588
First, there's the center of gravity.

938
00:45:35,613 --> 00:45:37,672
Second, there' the direction of force.

939
00:45:37,697 --> 00:45:41,156
Third, the creases usually form an X or Y shape.

940
00:45:41,502 --> 00:45:43,493
Now, with this in mind, we have to

941
00:45:43,495 --> 00:45:44,604
analyze photographs

942
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:45,783
like we are doing right now.

943
00:45:46,213 --> 00:45:49,192
Analyze the parts that stick out, like this

944
00:45:49,518 --> 00:45:52,026
and predict the direction of force.

945
00:45:53,393 --> 00:45:54,977
See how the arm goes inwards?

946
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,502
That's why the creases go up like this.

947
00:45:58,942 --> 00:46:00,221
I'll now pinpoint the centers of gravity.

948
00:46:02,007 --> 00:46:04,033
The direction of force spins inwards like this.

949
00:46:06,214 --> 00:46:09,026
If it spins,

950
00:46:09,105 --> 00:46:10,729
the creases will go in the same direction.

951
00:46:11,594 --> 00:46:13,174
But what if the direction of force

952
00:46:14,093 --> 00:46:15,643
goes in the opposite direction like this?

953
00:46:19,588 --> 00:46:20,777
Then, the creases would move in that direction.

954
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:31,619
You can also see that the arm goes inwards

955
00:46:31,713 --> 00:46:36,049
around the center of gravity here.

956
00:46:39,083 --> 00:46:42,026
Keep going and draw Y shapes and X shapes.

957
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:43,385
But, you might feel limitations

958
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:45,026
if you just draw X shapes and Y shapes

959
00:46:45,051 --> 00:46:46,611
like we've done so far.

960
00:46:46,636 --> 00:46:48,046
The thing is, with creases,

961
00:46:48,071 --> 00:46:50,327
they have a distinct pattern.

962
00:46:50,697 --> 00:46:52,822
Besides the large creases here,

963
00:46:53,322 --> 00:46:54,778
other creases are much smaller

964
00:46:54,803 --> 00:46:56,697
and have a more distinct shape pattern.

965
00:46:57,588 --> 00:47:00,346
So, when you draw this later,

966
00:47:00,424 --> 00:47:03,233
you need to focus on the important parts.

967
00:47:03,235 --> 00:47:06,177
You should only focus on what's important.

968
00:47:06,202 --> 00:47:08,547
So, where won't you draw creases?

969
00:47:08,572 --> 00:47:12,146
Usually, you'd draw creases around the joints.

970
00:47:12,268 --> 00:47:14,622
Because in real life, creases would usually form around here.

971
00:47:14,705 --> 00:47:15,850
So what happens if you look at creases

972
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:17,999
and translate them into an illustration?

973
00:47:18,283 --> 00:47:19,635
Let's look at the overall flow first.

974
00:47:19,713 --> 00:47:23,721
Overall, there are three centers of gravity here.

975
00:47:24,627 --> 00:47:27,158
The arm goes inwards, and so does the direction of force.

976
00:47:29,113 --> 00:47:31,729
Keep these in mind as you draw.

977
00:47:33,955 --> 00:47:37,931
But, when you're drawing the creases, because this area is large,

978
00:47:37,933 --> 00:47:39,018
we won't draw in many creases.

979
00:47:39,847 --> 00:47:41,604
However, we would draw a lot of creases

980
00:47:43,613 --> 00:47:45,617
around this joint here.

981
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:49,546
When we were learning how to draw the hair,

982
00:47:49,571 --> 00:47:51,878
remember I told you regular patterns don't look aesthetic?

983
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:54,332
Design-wise, it won't look pretty.

984
00:47:54,357 --> 00:47:57,316
This rule applies to the creases as well.

985
00:47:57,341 --> 00:47:59,651
If you want to draw a lot of creases

986
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:01,616
and draw them realistically,

987
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:02,813
it might actually be good to draw them in a regular pattern.

988
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:04,423
But, when you do that when practicing,

989
00:48:04,448 --> 00:48:07,416
it won't look good on the character

990
00:48:08,416 --> 00:48:09,751
and overall, it won't be aesthetic.

991
00:48:09,776 --> 00:48:12,040
So, in that case, focus on the parts

992
00:48:12,065 --> 00:48:13,782
where you want to draw a lot of creases.

993
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:16,635
I recommend you to draw creases only on those parts.

994
00:48:16,799 --> 00:48:18,810
Then, your workflow will be easier.

995
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:21,447
So, we don't have to draw in all the creases.

996
00:48:21,541 --> 00:48:23,455
Just draw the creases around the part you want to emphasize.

997
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,807
But, with that part,

998
00:48:26,182 --> 00:48:28,971
you really need to do your best

999
00:48:28,996 --> 00:48:31,338
and draw all the tiny creases.

1000
00:48:31,815 --> 00:48:33,615
Draw in the creases

1001
00:48:33,639 --> 00:48:35,408
while thinking of the X and Y shapes I've mentioned.

1002
00:48:36,777 --> 00:48:38,213
If you're done with that, don't draw creases for other areas.

1003
00:48:41,222 --> 00:48:45,010
If you don't draw the creases for those areas,

1004
00:48:45,035 --> 00:48:46,604
you can draw casual-style creases.

1005
00:48:49,878 --> 00:48:52,260
So, you would analyze the reference and use it.

1006
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:55,322
Pinpoint the centers of gravity

1007
00:48:57,633 --> 00:48:59,010
and the direction of force.

1008
00:49:01,236 --> 00:49:03,142
The direction here is the same as below.

1009
00:49:04,098 --> 00:49:06,335
But, the shirt here isn't pulled as much.

1010
00:49:07,002 --> 00:49:08,911
Maybe the shirt isn't as tight.

1011
00:49:09,111 --> 00:49:11,815
If it was, this area should be pulled a lot.

1012
00:49:12,527 --> 00:49:14,031
But, because this shirt isn't tight,

1013
00:49:14,055 --> 00:49:16,088
the creases here are quite loose.

1014
00:49:20,489 --> 00:49:25,111
So, you would draw in the creases as you keep analyzing.

1015
00:49:27,526 --> 00:49:30,372
Of course, this would not only apply to the arms

1016
00:49:30,374 --> 00:49:33,063
but also to the waist as well.

1017
00:49:33,088 --> 00:49:35,879
Although there will be some minor changes depending on the material,

1018
00:49:35,881 --> 00:49:37,962
the overall shape will stay the same.

1019
00:49:37,964 --> 00:49:41,026
This is how we would draw the creases.

1020
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:42,979
Now, I've mentioned

1021
00:49:44,526 --> 00:49:48,214
the creases could look different depending on the clothing itself.

1022
00:49:48,216 --> 00:49:51,518
So, let's study that in detail.

1023
00:49:54,284 --> 00:49:55,924
Generally, loose clothes

1024
00:49:55,949 --> 00:50:00,018
will have more vertical creases than horizontal creases.

1025
00:50:00,338 --> 00:50:02,643
In tight areas, there are more horizontal creases

1026
00:50:02,815 --> 00:50:04,453
than vertical ones.

1027
00:50:04,713 --> 00:50:06,031
Let me show you an example.

1028
00:50:06,033 --> 00:50:08,799
If some clothing wraps the arms tightly,

1029
00:50:08,824 --> 00:50:11,049
the creases will look like this.

1030
00:50:12,981 --> 00:50:14,760
If we fold clothes tightly,

1031
00:50:15,822 --> 00:50:19,110
it will tend to have a lot of horizontal creases like this.

1032
00:50:19,135 --> 00:50:20,648
Let's say we're wearing oversized clothes.

1033
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:23,815
Then, the cloth will tend to droop down.

1034
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:29,268
See how it droops down?

1035
00:50:34,807 --> 00:50:37,105
If we draw creases for that droop,

1036
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:38,674
we can express that the clothes are oversized.

1037
00:50:38,893 --> 00:50:41,690
So, with oversized clothes, draw vertical creases.

1038
00:50:42,018 --> 00:50:44,935
And with thin and tight clothes, draw horizontal creases.

1039
00:50:44,937 --> 00:50:46,393
Remember that.

1040
00:50:46,526 --> 00:50:51,135
As the cloth gets thicker, there will be less creases.

1041
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,518
Clothes like hoodies

1042
00:50:54,307 --> 00:50:55,765
or very thick coats

1043
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:58,307
don't tend to have a lot of creases.

1044
00:50:58,533 --> 00:51:00,911
On the other hand, clothes that are thin, like a shirt,

1045
00:51:00,913 --> 00:51:02,393
have a lot of creases.

1046
00:51:02,705 --> 00:51:04,190
Just remember that.

1047
00:51:04,295 --> 00:51:06,624
So, let's take an example

1048
00:51:07,502 --> 00:51:09,471
with a thick hoodie.

1049
00:51:09,554 --> 00:51:10,729
Let's go.

1050
00:51:18,519 --> 00:51:20,116
Let's say it's a thick hoodie

1051
00:51:22,007 --> 00:51:24,582
and that it is oversized.

1052
00:51:25,623 --> 00:51:27,336
The center of gravity is here.

1053
00:51:28,423 --> 00:51:30,043
And because it droops down,

1054
00:51:30,067 --> 00:51:32,034
there isn't much movement to it.

1055
00:51:32,907 --> 00:51:34,390
Just make sure

1056
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:36,796
the clothes flow in this direction.

1057
00:51:37,138 --> 00:51:38,796
It goes inwards here,

1058
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,898
if you move it slightly, like this,

1059
00:51:46,711 --> 00:51:50,140
make sure it goes inside the creases.

1060
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:56,398
We have the joint - so, we have to add more creases.

1061
00:51:57,246 --> 00:51:59,125
Think of the Y shape,

1062
00:52:02,242 --> 00:52:03,562
and in your head,

1063
00:52:03,587 --> 00:52:06,000
think of where the creases are sticking out.

1064
00:52:11,371 --> 00:52:14,000
See that the pattern here is used again?

1065
00:52:28,378 --> 00:52:29,284
Like this?

1066
00:52:33,301 --> 00:52:37,441
There are a lot of creases in the armpit area as well.

1067
00:52:38,484 --> 00:52:41,503
The area that I circled will be generally flat.

1068
00:52:42,082 --> 00:52:44,231
Draw vertical creases

1069
00:52:44,418 --> 00:52:46,503
and make sure they cover the waist.

1070
00:52:50,831 --> 00:52:52,753
In real life, around the waist,

1071
00:52:52,755 --> 00:52:54,941
the creases will be pulled left and right.

1072
00:52:55,925 --> 00:53:00,667
Because the cloth will fold left and right above the pelvis,

1073
00:53:09,589 --> 00:53:12,597
the creases would look like this.

1074
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:15,672
What if the waist turns around?

1075
00:53:15,776 --> 00:53:18,120
Let's say we're drawing something like a shirt.

1076
00:53:18,316 --> 00:53:21,081
Remember how they have tight creases?

1077
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:31,925
I'll draw the chest.

1078
00:53:36,909 --> 00:53:40,620
Because I don't think I taught you anatomy well,

1079
00:53:40,645 --> 00:53:41,922
I'll go into detail

1080
00:53:41,946 --> 00:53:44,378
in the bonus chapter.

1081
00:53:46,214 --> 00:53:47,818
In that lecture,

1082
00:53:47,843 --> 00:53:50,480
we're going to draw a human body together.

1083
00:53:50,505 --> 00:53:52,773
So, if you need practice,

1084
00:53:52,797 --> 00:53:54,886
study that video in detail.

1085
00:53:54,911 --> 00:53:57,955
I'm sure some of you

1086
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:00,120
could be disappointed with the curriculum

1087
00:54:00,145 --> 00:54:01,800
because this class doesn't cover the basics a lot.

1088
00:54:02,706 --> 00:54:05,867
But, still, it's always important

1089
00:54:05,869 --> 00:54:07,925
to stress their importance.

1090
00:54:09,191 --> 00:54:10,776
Actually, with the essentials,

1091
00:54:10,801 --> 00:54:14,581
I already went over them in the previous classes.

1092
00:54:14,894 --> 00:54:20,624
For this class, the most important thing would be

1093
00:54:20,649 --> 00:54:24,097
learning how to practice effectively

1094
00:54:24,122 --> 00:54:25,898
when going over the basics.

1095
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:30,617
Practicing with that in mind

1096
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:34,495
would be a more effective study method.

1097
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:37,730
Of course, I could teach you everything in this class.

1098
00:54:37,755 --> 00:54:38,987
But, in the end, to master the basics,

1099
00:54:39,012 --> 00:54:40,804
you actually have to practice by drawing.

1100
00:54:42,526 --> 00:54:45,526
So, please keep in mind what I taught you

1101
00:54:45,714 --> 00:54:47,886
in the previous lectures.

1102
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:49,577
I'm sure it will help you a lot

1103
00:54:49,601 --> 00:54:52,425
if you practice while watching the bonus lecture.

1104
00:54:59,894 --> 00:55:03,339
Make sure there are a lot of creases around the waistline.

1105
00:55:03,628 --> 00:55:07,597
The parts I'm coloring in right now are the creases that go inwards.

1106
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:10,792
This area is the part that goes outwards.

1107
00:55:11,487 --> 00:55:13,580
In your head, think of the area that goes outwards,

1108
00:55:13,605 --> 00:55:15,622
and with your hands, draw the area that goes inwards.

1109
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:18,862
That's why this process is hard.

1110
00:55:19,097 --> 00:55:22,318
But, as I mentioned, the pattern is always the same.

1111
00:55:22,343 --> 00:55:24,925
The X shapes and the Y shapes alternate.

1112
00:55:25,011 --> 00:55:28,424
So, once you are familiar with that,

1113
00:55:28,426 --> 00:55:30,087
drawing the creases will be easy.

1114
00:55:30,722 --> 00:55:32,397
But, before that, it's hard.

1115
00:55:32,399 --> 00:55:34,816
That's why you need to train while looking at photo references.

1116
00:55:35,144 --> 00:55:37,620
It's important to analyze photographs, like this.

1117
00:55:38,972 --> 00:55:40,134
Look at the patterns

1118
00:55:40,159 --> 00:55:42,524
and try finding where the 'dimensions'

1119
00:55:42,526 --> 00:55:43,589
would form creases.

1120
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:45,356
Remember what we have to keep in mind?

1121
00:55:45,358 --> 00:55:46,775
Analyze with this in mind

1122
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,543
and analyze the creases repetitively.

1123
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:49,784
Once you've analyzed it,

1124
00:55:49,808 --> 00:55:51,894
you can apply it in your drawings like this.

1125
00:55:53,108 --> 00:55:54,607
This area with loose clothing

1126
00:55:55,842 --> 00:55:57,343
and this area

1127
00:55:57,367 --> 00:56:00,191
with tight clothing need to be expressed.

1128
00:56:04,909 --> 00:56:06,867
Now, we would also need to

1129
00:56:06,891 --> 00:56:08,883
practice in a different method.

1130
00:56:08,884 --> 00:56:11,077
Because applying creases

1131
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:13,092
could be more difficult than you think.

1132
00:56:13,094 --> 00:56:16,019
Why is it difficult?

1133
00:56:16,159 --> 00:56:17,441
Remember when I said

1134
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:20,564
the creases are formed in X and Y shapes?

1135
00:56:20,566 --> 00:56:23,120
But, when we have X and Y shapes,

1136
00:56:23,145 --> 00:56:25,081
they aren't a perfect X or a Y shape.

1137
00:56:25,083 --> 00:56:26,542
In real life, they would be curved.

1138
00:56:27,761 --> 00:56:29,292
Even with the same Y shape,

1139
00:56:30,605 --> 00:56:33,175
if we look at it from above, it would look like this.

1140
00:56:35,008 --> 00:56:36,972
This is how it would look if we look at it

1141
00:56:38,995 --> 00:56:39,931
from underneath it.

1142
00:56:39,956 --> 00:56:43,112
So, depending on the gaze, the creases would look different.

1143
00:56:43,237 --> 00:56:44,781
And, later on,

1144
00:56:44,806 --> 00:56:47,042
you'll need to draw a fierce action scene.

1145
00:56:47,067 --> 00:56:50,878
The creases will look different depending on the action.

1146
00:56:52,918 --> 00:56:55,523
They will also be affected by the shape of the clothes.

1147
00:56:55,722 --> 00:56:58,745
So, I prepared this example to show you those examples.

1148
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:03,011
Previously, when I taught you about angles,

1149
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:06,980
remember when I divided them into different levels?

1150
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:09,480
The same thing is applied to the creases.

1151
00:57:10,191 --> 00:57:12,105
Like I mentioned the similar thing in the previous lecture,

1152
00:57:12,198 --> 00:57:13,892
if the creases look like this,

1153
00:57:13,917 --> 00:57:16,480
and if it's a high-angle, it would draw a concave line,

1154
00:57:16,605 --> 00:57:19,605
and if it's a low-angle, it would draw a convex line.

1155
00:57:19,761 --> 00:57:22,453
The creases would go to Level 1, Minus Level 1 from 0

1156
00:57:22,455 --> 00:57:23,619
and we would draw accordingly.

1157
00:57:23,934 --> 00:57:26,519
You need to be aware of how much you're curving the lines.

1158
00:57:27,507 --> 00:57:29,284
So, even if you're drawing the same creases,

1159
00:57:29,934 --> 00:57:31,171
when we look at it from above,

1160
00:57:31,195 --> 00:57:33,386
it will be a high angle.

1161
00:57:41,798 --> 00:57:44,011
Draw the creases around the waistline

1162
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,284
and make sure they are curved deeply inwards

1163
00:58:10,906 --> 00:58:13,157
just like this.

1164
00:58:13,944 --> 00:58:17,118
You would also draw the creases around the arms

1165
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:25,321
from a high-angle point of view.

1166
00:58:25,704 --> 00:58:27,868
If you apply angles, it will be more difficult.

1167
00:58:27,893 --> 00:58:29,380
So, just remember to apply them in Levels

1168
00:58:29,404 --> 00:58:31,352
and calculate how much they will be curved in your head.

1169
00:58:32,110 --> 00:58:35,797
It's important to calculate the curves.

1170
00:58:36,165 --> 00:58:38,790
Otherwise, you would tend to rely on your senses.

1171
00:58:40,555 --> 00:58:43,477
If you did so thus far,

1172
00:58:43,616 --> 00:58:45,265
imagine you're solving equations

1173
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:48,227
and calculate them in different Levels.

1174
00:58:49,008 --> 00:58:53,274
Then, you'd be able to draw in deep creases.

1175
00:58:56,102 --> 00:58:58,618
See how they go in deep?

1176
00:59:03,311 --> 00:59:05,891
The same is applied for thick clothing.

1177
00:59:06,814 --> 00:59:09,594
With low-angle clothes, do the exact opposite.

1178
00:59:12,898 --> 00:59:14,524
I'll draw high-angle creases

1179
00:59:22,509 --> 00:59:26,110
around the waistline and the direction of force in this example.

1180
00:59:40,198 --> 00:59:42,419
This is something very important.

1181
00:59:42,421 --> 00:59:44,436
The shoulder seam which I'm drawing now

1182
00:59:44,461 --> 00:59:47,150
and the other seams on the sideline

1183
00:59:47,418 --> 00:59:48,744
and on the back -

1184
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:52,424
never forget to draw them.

1185
00:59:52,729 --> 00:59:54,139
When you depict the clothing material,

1186
00:59:54,163 --> 00:59:55,870
drawing them will help you a lot.

1187
00:59:55,872 --> 00:59:59,088
And later, when you want to draw more in detail,

1188
00:59:59,159 --> 01:00:02,455
because this is the seam, for example,

1189
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:03,878
you can draw extra creases

1190
01:00:06,221 --> 01:00:07,818
around here.

1191
01:00:07,842 --> 01:00:10,082
Then, you'd be able to draw more in detail.

1192
01:00:10,284 --> 01:00:12,329
So, never underestimate the seams!

1193
01:00:12,354 --> 01:00:14,713
It's really important when drawing clothes.

1194
01:00:14,854 --> 01:00:16,034
So please remember that.

1195
01:00:16,987 --> 01:00:21,807
If you want to be a concept artist in the future,

1196
01:00:21,948 --> 01:00:25,096
noticing details like this will be very important.

1197
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:26,205
It's important to draw the seams.

1198
01:00:28,198 --> 01:00:29,366
You'll draw in a lot of seams

1199
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:31,369
when you are drawing armor.

1200
01:00:34,293 --> 01:00:36,018
So, remember to draw them.

1201
01:00:37,659 --> 01:00:38,725
I want to show you the nuance for this example.

1202
01:00:38,749 --> 01:00:41,531
When there's action,

1203
01:00:41,533 --> 01:00:44,635
especially when it's fierce, the creases become 'fierce' as well.

1204
01:00:44,637 --> 01:00:45,798
Like hair,

1205
01:00:45,823 --> 01:00:48,221
deformers are applied to the creases.

1206
01:00:48,604 --> 01:00:51,108
So, let's say you want to draw a fierce action scene.

1207
01:00:51,133 --> 01:00:53,616
When you say 'fierce', do you think of straight lines

1208
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:54,799
or curved lines?

1209
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:57,948
You'd think of straight lines rather than curved ones.

1210
01:00:58,318 --> 01:01:01,922
So, in that situation, the creases would be straight.

1211
01:01:03,508 --> 01:01:05,103
And remember with tight clothes,

1212
01:01:05,105 --> 01:01:06,617
horizontal creases are usually formed?

1213
01:01:20,399 --> 01:01:23,500
So, drawing straight creases

1214
01:01:23,907 --> 01:01:27,446
would show the viewers

1215
01:01:28,962 --> 01:01:30,571
there's a lot of action in it.

1216
01:01:32,393 --> 01:01:35,516
Even if the situation and the clothes are the same,

1217
01:01:41,212 --> 01:01:43,024
you can see that drawing vertical creases

1218
01:01:45,830 --> 01:01:49,735
with a round sleeve

1219
01:01:53,798 --> 01:01:55,423
and drawing short horizontal creases

1220
01:01:56,256 --> 01:01:57,782
that are straight

1221
01:01:59,362 --> 01:02:06,188
and meet each other

1222
01:02:17,794 --> 01:02:18,727
create

1223
01:02:18,729 --> 01:02:19,774
extremely different

1224
01:02:19,798 --> 01:02:21,632
moods.

1225
01:02:24,262 --> 01:02:26,089
So, your deformers would change

1226
01:02:26,114 --> 01:02:28,755
if the crease lines change according to the situation.

1227
01:02:30,833 --> 01:02:34,122
Now, I'd like to show you

1228
01:02:34,147 --> 01:02:35,760
the creases on pants and skirts.

1229
01:02:36,143 --> 01:02:37,630
With pants, usually,

1230
01:02:37,655 --> 01:02:40,507
creases are formed around the hip joint.

1231
01:02:40,907 --> 01:02:41,795
Right around here.

1232
01:02:41,819 --> 01:02:43,635
Draw the seams here.

1233
01:02:44,526 --> 01:02:47,270
Also, creases are formed around the knees.

1234
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:49,713
But, we usually don't draw creases here.

1235
01:02:49,884 --> 01:02:51,213
Nevertheless, if you're drawing illustrations,

1236
01:02:51,385 --> 01:02:53,704
just drawing small creases around here

1237
01:02:53,706 --> 01:02:56,152
will help you describe creases naturally.

1238
01:02:56,177 --> 01:02:57,721
So, just keep that in mind.

1239
01:02:58,221 --> 01:03:01,494
Remember that creases are usually formed around the hip joint.

1240
01:03:02,119 --> 01:03:08,104
There are a lot of different types of skirts.

1241
01:03:08,385 --> 01:03:12,674
But, a lot of students find it hard to draw frilled skirts.

1242
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:15,744
When you're drawing the frills,

1243
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:19,166
draw the outlines at the bottom first.

1244
01:03:20,577 --> 01:03:23,658
But, I'd like to emphasize

1245
01:03:24,393 --> 01:03:27,502
that skirts are made up of cloth, too.

1246
01:03:27,527 --> 01:03:29,815
But, the cloth has some thickness to it.

1247
01:03:29,914 --> 01:03:31,283
It's important to remember that.

1248
01:03:31,588 --> 01:03:33,842
So, when you're drawing,

1249
01:03:33,866 --> 01:03:35,682
if you draw just like this,

1250
01:03:37,083 --> 01:03:40,768
the cloth will have little to no thickness.

1251
01:03:41,065 --> 01:03:42,738
This area would just be a dot.

1252
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:45,173
So, to create thickness,

1253
01:03:45,174 --> 01:03:47,494
would be to disconnect these lines.

1254
01:03:48,463 --> 01:03:50,380
What would happen then?

1255
01:03:50,405 --> 01:03:52,287
In this area,

1256
01:03:52,311 --> 01:03:55,690
there are only two dimensions, the upper part and the lower part.

1257
01:03:55,692 --> 01:03:57,190
But, what would happen here?

1258
01:03:57,346 --> 01:04:03,111
There's the upper dimension, the inner dimension,

1259
01:04:04,354 --> 01:04:05,522
and the third dimension,

1260
01:04:06,377 --> 01:04:08,096
which is the lower dimension.

1261
01:04:09,799 --> 01:04:11,016
This is very important.

1262
01:04:11,041 --> 01:04:12,584
Whether this dimension exists or not

1263
01:04:12,608 --> 01:04:14,401
decides if this skirt will have thickness or not.

1264
01:04:14,776 --> 01:04:17,393
So, when you're drawing the frills,

1265
01:04:17,885 --> 01:04:21,104
you might have seen what I drew in other online classes.

1266
01:04:22,071 --> 01:04:23,760
If you've studied more before,

1267
01:04:24,213 --> 01:04:25,920
you might say it's enough to just connect these lines.

1268
01:04:25,944 --> 01:04:27,471
But actually, that's not enough.

1269
01:04:27,604 --> 01:04:30,505
If you want to color it to show volume,

1270
01:04:30,507 --> 01:04:33,651
it's really important to give some thickness to the clothes.

1271
01:04:37,565 --> 01:04:39,383
So, if you approach it like that,

1272
01:04:39,408 --> 01:04:41,846
you can draw a much more voluminous cloth.

1273
01:04:43,526 --> 01:04:45,415
Let's wrap it up.

1274
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:48,760
The important thing with creases is the center of gravity,

1275
01:04:49,065 --> 01:04:52,182
the direction of force, and the X and Y shapes.

1276
01:04:52,572 --> 01:04:54,371
You would practice drawing them by

1277
01:04:54,373 --> 01:04:57,541
first analyzing patterns from photographs.

1278
01:04:58,041 --> 01:05:02,260
Second, you would modify the creases from the photo.

1279
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:05,415
Think about where you would apply more creases

1280
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,541
and keep practicing with the actual drawing.

1281
01:05:09,046 --> 01:05:12,119
Third, apply deformers to the creases

1282
01:05:14,808 --> 01:05:17,393
that are modified.

1283
01:05:17,616 --> 01:05:21,127
If you want to show action, draw straight creases.

1284
01:05:21,991 --> 01:05:23,877
If not, draw rounded creases.

1285
01:05:24,010 --> 01:05:26,510
Also, practice how to apply different angles.

1286
01:05:26,619 --> 01:05:28,616
Practicing with these modifications

1287
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:29,806
would be the third step.

1288
01:05:30,049 --> 01:05:34,432
If you keep these in mind while drawing,

1289
01:05:34,457 --> 01:05:38,080
you'll eventually master drawing them someday.

1290
01:05:38,283 --> 01:05:39,763
It actually doesn't take long

1291
01:05:39,788 --> 01:05:42,002
to master how to draw creases.

1292
01:05:42,291 --> 01:05:47,604
So, if you focus on your practice and the thought process,

1293
01:05:47,901 --> 01:05:50,838
you'll master it faster than you think.

1294
01:05:50,863 --> 01:05:54,010
But, there's a big difference when you think of the final result beforehand.

1295
01:05:54,035 --> 01:05:56,127
So, you should keep that in mind.

1296
01:05:57,674 --> 01:06:00,086
So, up to today's lecture,

1297
01:06:00,111 --> 01:06:03,533
we've covered the basics of drawing.

1298
01:06:04,791 --> 01:06:09,736
Previously, I told you how to simply draw a character's body

1299
01:06:09,761 --> 01:06:12,197
by applying proportions.

1300
01:06:12,222 --> 01:06:15,588
We also briefly went over how to practice.

1301
01:06:15,862 --> 01:06:18,993
In regards to that, I'll upload a bonus lecture.

1302
01:06:19,018 --> 01:06:21,117
So, it would be good to watch that video also.

1303
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:24,938
We learned how to draw a well-proportioned mannequin

1304
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:28,385
that has a certain pose.

1305
01:06:28,476 --> 01:06:31,399
We also learned how to draw the head and face.

1306
01:06:31,401 --> 01:06:34,431
You can now also draw the hair and clothes.

1307
01:06:34,433 --> 01:06:36,958
So, theoretically, you can draw a character

1308
01:06:36,983 --> 01:06:39,713
from what you have learned so far.

1309
01:06:40,104 --> 01:06:42,985
So, now you can master the basics

1310
01:06:43,010 --> 01:06:45,940
by practicing what we've learned so far.

1311
01:06:46,236 --> 01:06:48,307
But is that all?

1312
01:06:48,308 --> 01:06:51,162
Actually, you also need to draw the background

1313
01:06:51,187 --> 01:06:54,604
and learn how to set the composition for an illustration.

1314
01:06:54,877 --> 01:06:56,446
But, always remember

1315
01:06:56,471 --> 01:06:59,424
that drawing the character is the core in character illustration.

1316
01:06:59,449 --> 01:07:02,319
So, that would mean it is very important to know how to

1317
01:07:02,343 --> 01:07:03,486
practice drawing one.

1318
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:07,213
And, the other theoretical content that I will explain later,

1319
01:07:07,238 --> 01:07:11,702
such as showing a certain situation, composing,

1320
01:07:11,704 --> 01:07:12,873
and drawing the character's gaze,

1321
01:07:12,897 --> 01:07:16,601
you can understand most of what's important

1322
01:07:16,603 --> 01:07:18,306
through my class.

1323
01:07:18,308 --> 01:07:23,079
But, learning how to draw the human body

1324
01:07:23,104 --> 01:07:25,024
so that it won't look flat

1325
01:07:25,049 --> 01:07:28,033
takes a very long time.

1326
01:07:28,058 --> 01:07:31,876
So, don't assume that what I taught you so far

1327
01:07:31,901 --> 01:07:34,377
has actually improved your skills.

1328
01:07:34,416 --> 01:07:38,204
I'd recommend you to

1329
01:07:38,229 --> 01:07:40,537
actually practice drawing

1330
01:07:40,549 --> 01:07:42,836
based on what you've learned so far.

1331
01:07:42,861 --> 01:07:45,755
I think that would be good.

1332
01:07:46,268 --> 01:07:47,975
So, now that I'm done,

1333
01:07:47,999 --> 01:07:49,891
I'll wrap up today's lecture.

1334
01:07:49,979 --> 01:07:53,446
From the next lecture, we're going to learn

1335
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:56,249
how you would approach drawing a character

1336
01:07:56,251 --> 01:07:57,679
in an illustration.

1337
01:07:57,906 --> 01:07:59,225
Keep up the good work.

1338
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:01,406
That's the end of today's class.
