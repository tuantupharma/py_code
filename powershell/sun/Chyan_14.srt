2
00:00:06,501 --> 00:00:07,551
Hello.

3
00:00:07,562 --> 00:00:09,409
Based on what we went through in the previous class,

4
00:00:09,434 --> 00:00:10,715
we are going to change

5
00:00:10,746 --> 00:00:12,581
the mood

6
00:00:12,606 --> 00:00:14,100
of our character again.

7
00:00:14,658 --> 00:00:16,473
Last time, we changed it to a cute vibe,

8
00:00:16,498 --> 00:00:18,598
and a calm mood.

9
00:00:18,622 --> 00:00:19,852
Today, I'm going to change this character

10
00:00:19,877 --> 00:00:21,588
to be more aggressive,

11
00:00:21,599 --> 00:00:22,606
and after that,

12
00:00:22,617 --> 00:00:25,033
by applying various lighting conditions,

13
00:00:25,057 --> 00:00:26,533
we'll take a look at

14
00:00:26,557 --> 00:00:27,700
other examples.

15
00:00:28,222 --> 00:00:29,514
Then first of all,

16
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:31,800
we're going to change it to a more aggressive image,

17
00:00:31,962 --> 00:00:34,267
so we need to talk about what we need to do to achieve that.

18
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:36,033
Let's review what we went through

19
00:00:36,099 --> 00:00:37,990
from when we expressed a cute character and a calm character

20
00:00:38,014 --> 00:00:40,133
in the previous lecture.

21
00:00:47,094 --> 00:00:48,287
The cute character.

22
00:00:48,311 --> 00:00:50,286
Of course, we can't apply it to everything,

23
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:52,335
there are different ways of directing,

24
00:00:53,707 --> 00:00:55,700
so it's good to know that before you move on.

25
00:00:57,504 --> 00:00:58,523
Intensity.

26
00:00:59,838 --> 00:01:02,078
Let's write down each characteristic.

27
00:01:02,288 --> 00:01:04,131
So I said,

28
00:01:04,141 --> 00:01:05,195
adjusting the contrast

29
00:01:07,188 --> 00:01:08,400
is important

30
00:01:11,587 --> 00:01:18,005
to make a strong image

31
00:01:18,233 --> 00:01:20,067
but one which is not too bright

32
00:01:20,091 --> 00:01:21,800
at a glance.

33
00:01:22,622 --> 00:01:27,835
And the main elements, and sub elements.

34
00:01:29,004 --> 00:01:33,430
The closer the distance is, the better it would be.

35
00:01:35,769 --> 00:01:38,391
And various point elements,

36
00:01:42,408 --> 00:01:46,067
I told you it's important to apply them,

37
00:01:46,092 --> 00:01:48,500
although the concentration might be a bit distracting,

38
00:01:48,524 --> 00:01:49,857
by applying them that much,

39
00:01:49,881 --> 00:01:51,700
we need to make a full screen.

40
00:01:51,724 --> 00:01:53,327
I said it's important before.

41
00:01:54,301 --> 00:01:57,802
And overall, an image with warm coloring

42
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:01,597
would be more suitable in some ways.

43
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,821
And what else?

44
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,798
A cute situation,

45
00:02:08,486 --> 00:02:09,833
in particular, the situation

46
00:02:09,857 --> 00:02:10,933
has to be given, and it's really important.

47
00:02:10,957 --> 00:02:12,220
That's what I said.

48
00:02:12,387 --> 00:02:13,575
And the one with a calm image,

49
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,804
unlike this,

50
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:17,999
your eyes need to be comfortable,

51
00:02:18,245 --> 00:02:21,999
so the gaze has to move

52
00:02:22,024 --> 00:02:23,104
calmly,

53
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,021
and slowly,

54
00:02:26,776 --> 00:02:28,829
the main element shouldn't take up too much space,

55
00:02:35,094 --> 00:02:36,966
so not stretching out the main element too much,

56
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:38,100
but by reducing it a little bit,

57
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:40,282
to make sure to focus on the areas you need,

58
00:02:40,307 --> 00:02:42,600
and for the rest of the sections, you can see them loosely.

59
00:02:42,624 --> 00:02:44,633
That's how it goes.

60
00:02:44,782 --> 00:02:47,808
Main element and sub elements,

61
00:02:49,707 --> 00:02:50,920
and the distance,

62
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,928
contrary to the cute character,

63
00:02:52,953 --> 00:02:54,413
I placed it far away.

64
00:02:56,337 --> 00:02:57,504
By removing

65
00:02:57,529 --> 00:02:59,133
the things that get in the way around it,

66
00:02:59,158 --> 00:03:00,221
such as point elements,

67
00:03:03,051 --> 00:03:05,400
compose an empty canvas.

68
00:03:05,424 --> 00:03:06,933
Like the saying goes, "less is more".

69
00:03:06,957 --> 00:03:09,305
I've made a calm image

70
00:03:10,003 --> 00:03:11,725
by composing an empty canvas

71
00:03:13,612 --> 00:03:15,796
and by using cool colors.

72
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:17,867
We used the surrounding elements,

73
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:19,685
among them, in the previous lecture,

74
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,797
we used water,

75
00:03:21,822 --> 00:03:23,503
in highlighting.

76
00:03:23,527 --> 00:03:25,967
Cute characters also have quite a lot of the highlights,

77
00:03:27,891 --> 00:03:30,016
and since this one is also a point element,

78
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:31,692
we applied it a lot.

79
00:03:33,308 --> 00:03:35,002
But this has highlights slightly added.

80
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,100
So those are the differences.

81
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:38,244
Then today,

82
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:40,200
let's work on building a strong character.

83
00:03:40,545 --> 00:03:41,799
Usually, the overall contrast

84
00:03:41,823 --> 00:03:42,833
of the strong character,

85
00:03:42,857 --> 00:03:44,667
compared to the previous two ones,

86
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:45,967
it needs to be much stronger.

87
00:03:46,028 --> 00:03:48,433
So that you can have a strong image at a glance.

88
00:03:48,457 --> 00:03:50,457
The bright image that I mentioned earlier,

89
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:51,800
is used for this.

90
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:54,700
The overall color of the character is white.

91
00:03:54,724 --> 00:03:57,177
Then it would be nice if the background color is a bit dark.

92
00:03:59,017 --> 00:04:00,116
Like this.

93
00:04:00,498 --> 00:04:03,722
It's okay to change it to completely black,

94
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:08,900
or give it a reddish color,

95
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,802
or a blue vibe.

96
00:04:10,827 --> 00:04:11,993
Either way,

97
00:04:12,017 --> 00:04:13,283
it's better to have some contrast,

98
00:04:13,688 --> 00:04:14,736
between the background

99
00:04:14,746 --> 00:04:17,491
and this character.

100
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,808
And here comes a difference between this one

101
00:04:19,832 --> 00:04:21,300
and the cute character.

102
00:04:21,324 --> 00:04:22,533
For the cute character,

103
00:04:22,557 --> 00:04:25,418
by placing a lot of sub-elements in the main elements,

104
00:04:25,476 --> 00:04:27,781
we spread the gaze a little bit.

105
00:04:27,886 --> 00:04:28,894
Why did we do that?

106
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:30,534
If you get to concentrate too much,

107
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:32,120
it feels like a movie.

108
00:04:32,144 --> 00:04:34,000
So if you concentrate too much,

109
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,468
it feels like its more serious,

110
00:04:35,492 --> 00:04:37,492
and it makes us feel serious.

111
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,982
So the one like a kid,

112
00:04:39,007 --> 00:04:40,579
has to be distractive.

113
00:04:40,727 --> 00:04:43,033
To give a distractive vibe,

114
00:04:43,058 --> 00:04:45,336
I spread the main elements.

115
00:04:46,294 --> 00:04:48,793
Then, this strong image is actually,

116
00:04:48,818 --> 00:04:50,745
if you compare it

117
00:04:51,092 --> 00:04:52,095
in that way,

118
00:04:52,105 --> 00:04:54,022
it has to have a strong impression,

119
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,008
which you can sense,

120
00:04:58,033 --> 00:04:59,398
at a glance,

121
00:05:03,695 --> 00:05:06,294
so I'm not going to put a lot of sub elements.

122
00:05:08,692 --> 00:05:10,410
And for that,

123
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,501
we're going to give it a different light.

124
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:16,584
Let's use the one

125
00:05:16,609 --> 00:05:18,133
that we used before.

126
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,704
Of course, we can use these lights as they are,

127
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:26,861
I'm going to change the lighting a little bit more.

128
00:05:29,301 --> 00:05:31,059
When we studied about lighting,

129
00:05:31,084 --> 00:05:33,820
we talked about Soft Light and Hard Light.

130
00:05:34,286 --> 00:05:36,200
This one has a strong image

131
00:05:36,224 --> 00:05:38,333
and with the image that bursts out at once,

132
00:05:38,358 --> 00:05:39,733
I'm only going to show

133
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:41,233
a certain amount of the information in a character.

134
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,890
We decided not to add the surrounding elements.

135
00:05:43,003 --> 00:05:45,901
Therefore, you need to be able to show a lot of things in a character.

136
00:05:46,394 --> 00:05:47,399
If so,

137
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,500
rather than a simple Hard Light,

138
00:05:49,525 --> 00:05:51,598
do Soft Light, which is applied more smoothly.

139
00:05:51,831 --> 00:05:53,180
So there are many layers of light and shade.

140
00:05:53,287 --> 00:05:55,466
The bright part and the dark part,

141
00:05:55,491 --> 00:05:58,004
and the darker parts with the very dark parts,

142
00:05:58,028 --> 00:05:59,687
they're divided into different layers.

143
00:05:59,712 --> 00:06:01,428
I mentioned there's more information.

144
00:06:01,453 --> 00:06:03,484
Therefore, the Soft Light is a bit more

145
00:06:03,508 --> 00:06:05,800
effective in my point of view.

146
00:06:07,309 --> 00:06:08,672
Let's use the strong light

147
00:06:08,697 --> 00:06:10,476
heading to the face

148
00:06:10,501 --> 00:06:11,522
of the character.

149
00:06:17,986 --> 00:06:20,600
Instead, let's make sure,

150
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:21,919
the areas where light doesn't reach,

151
00:06:29,677 --> 00:06:31,107
will be dark.

152
00:06:31,302 --> 00:06:33,191
The creature in the back

153
00:06:37,327 --> 00:06:39,292
also has to be dark.

154
00:06:41,295 --> 00:06:43,639
So I will change the background

155
00:06:43,664 --> 00:06:45,004
to make it close to black.

156
00:06:45,502 --> 00:06:47,779
If it's blue and black,

157
00:06:47,804 --> 00:06:49,599
I think it'll fit this image.

158
00:06:54,466 --> 00:06:57,719
It's going to give a strong and cold image,

159
00:06:57,743 --> 00:06:58,861
since the key color

160
00:06:58,871 --> 00:07:00,564
of this character is bluish,

161
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:01,882
to show

162
00:07:01,906 --> 00:07:03,491
the bluish color effectively,

163
00:07:03,616 --> 00:07:04,833
I think it's good to draw it

164
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:07,031
a bit cold.

165
00:07:11,844 --> 00:07:14,218
I'll choose the areas with mint color.

166
00:07:14,313 --> 00:07:15,450
What I'm using right now

167
00:07:15,475 --> 00:07:16,910
is the Magic Wand tool.

168
00:07:17,608 --> 00:07:18,785
The basic shortcut is probably

169
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,605
the W key.

170
00:07:21,005 --> 00:07:22,935
So if you press W,

171
00:07:22,946 --> 00:07:24,995
you can use it a little faster.

172
00:07:31,696 --> 00:07:33,897
I'm going to make the overall brightness a bit darker.

173
00:07:35,476 --> 00:07:37,033
And I'm going to make it hard to see.

174
00:07:37,402 --> 00:07:39,410
But, I mentioned before that I'm going for a strong impression.

175
00:07:39,468 --> 00:07:41,876
Then how come I'm making these hard to see?

176
00:07:41,901 --> 00:07:43,257
Because the area I want to show clearly is

177
00:07:43,282 --> 00:07:44,717
the face area here.

178
00:07:44,804 --> 00:07:46,721
When I first composed this illustration,

179
00:07:46,746 --> 00:07:47,967
in other words, when I was drawing the thumbnail,

180
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:49,570
I wanted to make the face the main element.

181
00:07:49,581 --> 00:07:50,588
That's what I said,

182
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:51,862
and I'm maintaining it.

183
00:07:51,873 --> 00:07:54,800
So, to make the face the main element,

184
00:07:54,824 --> 00:07:56,992
I'm only going to make this part strong.

185
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:02,614
Like this.

186
00:08:10,096 --> 00:08:11,338
Similarly, I'm going to make the character's eyes

187
00:08:11,363 --> 00:08:12,567
give a strong impression.

188
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:13,700
Here's a tip.

189
00:08:13,725 --> 00:08:16,697
If you're going to add a lot of descriptions,

190
00:08:16,815 --> 00:08:19,400
it might actually be good to put in less description

191
00:08:19,425 --> 00:08:21,909
to the area you want to highlight.

192
00:08:22,091 --> 00:08:24,265
If there's no description of one area,

193
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,667
while there's a lot of description in the other area,

194
00:08:26,691 --> 00:08:27,800
the area without description

195
00:08:27,824 --> 00:08:29,718
will look a bit intense.

196
00:08:32,908 --> 00:08:35,414
That's why this kind of coloring

197
00:08:35,439 --> 00:08:36,726
works pretty well.

198
00:08:38,948 --> 00:08:40,894
But like I just said,

199
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:43,199
with this coloring,

200
00:08:43,506 --> 00:08:44,870
there should be a lot of description in the other areas.

201
00:08:45,248 --> 00:08:47,327
So, you need to describe the areas around it.

202
00:09:02,299 --> 00:09:04,531
I'll make the center of the head bright

203
00:09:09,487 --> 00:09:11,507
and make the center of the teeth bright.

204
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:14,513
I'll put everything in the middle,

205
00:09:14,538 --> 00:09:16,306
and I'm going to put in less description for the other areas.

206
00:09:16,317 --> 00:09:17,240
And,

207
00:09:17,251 --> 00:09:19,227
if you can't see anything in the area with less description,

208
00:09:19,261 --> 00:09:20,600
it will be a bit boring,

209
00:09:20,624 --> 00:09:22,367
Then it would be nice to

210
00:09:22,391 --> 00:09:25,016
see some detail for that area.

211
00:09:25,187 --> 00:09:26,201
This circled area

212
00:09:26,225 --> 00:09:28,225
is the part we're going to focus on.

213
00:09:29,112 --> 00:09:30,550
It's good to arrange a little bit of

214
00:09:30,575 --> 00:09:32,703
what you want to show around it.

215
00:09:32,727 --> 00:09:35,320
So, what element

216
00:09:35,433 --> 00:09:36,500
can play that role?

217
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:38,712
Let's think about that.

218
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,955
I'll make the tentacles in front of us

219
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,914
darker like this.

220
00:10:15,675 --> 00:10:17,743
I'll draw it

221
00:10:17,754 --> 00:10:18,761
as I show you

222
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:20,501
a bit of each part.

223
00:10:20,744 --> 00:10:22,067
The light coming from the

224
00:10:22,091 --> 00:10:24,013
back of this border

225
00:10:24,202 --> 00:10:25,304
is called the Backlight.

226
00:10:25,329 --> 00:10:26,540
The official name

227
00:10:26,565 --> 00:10:27,753
of this light

228
00:10:27,778 --> 00:10:29,904
would be Rim Light.

229
00:10:30,495 --> 00:10:32,394
The light that comes into the border

230
00:10:32,418 --> 00:10:33,495
of the character

231
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,208
makes the silhouette

232
00:10:36,025 --> 00:10:37,798
quite clear.

233
00:10:38,335 --> 00:10:40,222
It's one of the lightings

234
00:10:40,247 --> 00:10:41,693
that's used a lot in game illustrations.

235
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,667
People use it to the extent that

236
00:10:45,692 --> 00:10:47,413
they seem too dependent on Rim Light.

237
00:10:47,735 --> 00:10:49,005
So it's important to learn

238
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,124
how to use Rim Light.

239
00:10:51,591 --> 00:10:52,604
The important thing is

240
00:10:52,629 --> 00:10:54,116
that it is a light coming from behind.

241
00:10:54,141 --> 00:10:56,346
That's what's important.

242
00:10:56,587 --> 00:10:59,800
It's all about coloring

243
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,403
where there is light,

244
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:02,933
so it's not about drawing outlines.

245
00:11:02,957 --> 00:11:04,700
In the area where the hair is covered,

246
00:11:04,725 --> 00:11:05,856
if you think that there would be no light,

247
00:11:05,881 --> 00:11:07,675
it's better not to color this part.

248
00:11:07,699 --> 00:11:09,201
Or you can add just a little bit of light.

249
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,104
Get rid of the areas

250
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,286
where there won't be light coming in.

251
00:11:12,311 --> 00:11:15,013
It's something very important and simple.

252
00:11:15,037 --> 00:11:16,527
But when most people

253
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:17,771
start to put in Rim Light,

254
00:11:17,796 --> 00:11:19,007
many people draw it

255
00:11:19,032 --> 00:11:20,197
like drawing a border.

256
00:11:20,893 --> 00:11:23,011
You have to be careful not to do that.

257
00:11:31,755 --> 00:11:32,791
Overall,

258
00:11:32,802 --> 00:11:34,700
I'll keep

259
00:11:34,725 --> 00:11:36,409
applying blue colors.

260
00:11:36,644 --> 00:11:38,350
The Soft Light applied in the middle

261
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:39,668
and the color itself

262
00:11:39,693 --> 00:11:41,907
will look bluish.

263
00:11:44,297 --> 00:11:45,397
A cool color

264
00:11:45,421 --> 00:11:47,821
can give off a cold feeling.

265
00:11:54,536 --> 00:11:56,400
So, how are you going to show

266
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,444
the border areas

267
00:11:57,469 --> 00:11:59,133
that you couldn't see?

268
00:11:59,157 --> 00:12:00,583
I'm going to explain it now.

269
00:12:00,608 --> 00:12:02,590
We're going to use the highlights.

270
00:12:02,887 --> 00:12:04,700
It's similar to what we did before.

271
00:12:04,787 --> 00:12:06,280
But I'm going to show the areas I want to show

272
00:12:08,517 --> 00:12:10,594
little by little,

273
00:12:10,619 --> 00:12:12,580
just like I did when I created a calm character.

274
00:12:12,935 --> 00:12:14,930
I'm going to do this by

275
00:12:15,021 --> 00:12:16,737
applying the highlights little by little everywhere.

276
00:12:18,285 --> 00:12:20,000
Especially the belt.

277
00:12:20,024 --> 00:12:21,919
This area where the belt is placed like this.

278
00:12:21,944 --> 00:12:23,914
The most effective way to express that is

279
00:12:23,938 --> 00:12:26,087
drawing the light coming from the top like this.

280
00:12:29,237 --> 00:12:30,666
Do it like this.

281
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:31,699
Yes, that's it.

282
00:12:31,723 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm not going to depict this in detail.

283
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:35,493
There are times when I don't express it

284
00:12:35,518 --> 00:12:37,253
until it's actually done.

285
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,733
You might ask if you can do that,

286
00:12:40,757 --> 00:12:43,503
because if you see as you work on it,

287
00:12:43,527 --> 00:12:45,527
it might look unfinished.

288
00:12:45,551 --> 00:12:47,800
But if you look at it from afar,

289
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:50,467
the belt area is very small,

290
00:12:50,491 --> 00:12:52,533
and this area is the top area.

291
00:12:52,557 --> 00:12:54,033
That's how it's depicted.

292
00:12:54,057 --> 00:12:55,970
So, you don't have to depict anymore from here

293
00:12:56,232 --> 00:12:58,520
since it already has three-dimensional details.

294
00:12:58,693 --> 00:13:00,393
So, later on,

295
00:13:00,417 --> 00:13:02,000
although we would depict this area

296
00:13:02,024 --> 00:13:03,533
in more detail later,

297
00:13:03,557 --> 00:13:05,819
this is how you would control the amount of description.

298
00:13:06,332 --> 00:13:07,998
The subtraction itself,

299
00:13:08,396 --> 00:13:09,896
where you exclude the detail

300
00:13:10,053 --> 00:13:11,700
in the unnecessary sections,

301
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:12,927
is very important.

302
00:13:13,099 --> 00:13:15,610
Especially for those who are drawing for the first time,

303
00:13:15,634 --> 00:13:18,298
or for those who have the desire to draw cool illustrations,

304
00:13:19,396 --> 00:13:21,433
and especially for those who

305
00:13:21,457 --> 00:13:22,533
want to make something look cool,

306
00:13:22,557 --> 00:13:25,612
I've seen a lot of cases where they can't control the amount of description.

307
00:13:26,782 --> 00:13:28,700
The problem that usually happens

308
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,982
doesn't happen because there's no detail

309
00:13:31,006 --> 00:13:33,598
or because they can't depict it well.

310
00:13:33,651 --> 00:13:34,817
The most common problem happens because

311
00:13:34,842 --> 00:13:36,751
there is too much description.

312
00:13:37,587 --> 00:13:39,467
Because there is too much description,

313
00:13:39,491 --> 00:13:42,133
and because you can't control the amount of description,

314
00:13:42,157 --> 00:13:44,615
the amount of description keeps being divided.

315
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,321
There's too much description here and there.

316
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,791
The area that will be shown has been decided.

317
00:13:50,815 --> 00:13:52,833
We decided to show the face.

318
00:13:53,097 --> 00:13:55,107
I'm not going to show the bottom too much.

319
00:13:55,181 --> 00:13:56,322
Then the part that won't be shown

320
00:13:56,347 --> 00:13:57,822
won't need to be put into detail that much.

321
00:13:58,099 --> 00:13:59,713
Because that area won't be shown.

322
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,096
The description

323
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:02,899
will be placed in the areas that you want to show the viewers.

324
00:14:03,298 --> 00:14:05,767
Depict the areas in detail

325
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,759
that you want the viewers to see.

326
00:14:07,783 --> 00:14:09,000
If the area

327
00:14:09,024 --> 00:14:10,849
is not that important,

328
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,800
it's a good method to

329
00:14:11,824 --> 00:14:13,367
just take out

330
00:14:13,391 --> 00:14:14,867
the descriptive details.

331
00:14:17,401 --> 00:14:18,513
I'm telling you this

332
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,533
because I hope

333
00:14:20,557 --> 00:14:22,527
you can change your perception.

334
00:14:22,551 --> 00:14:23,934
Description is not compulsory

335
00:14:23,944 --> 00:14:25,023
in illustrations.

336
00:14:25,034 --> 00:14:26,164
Gradations

337
00:14:26,211 --> 00:14:28,291
or descriptions are actually sub elements.

338
00:14:28,789 --> 00:14:31,694
It's almost done when the lighting starts...

339
00:14:31,718 --> 00:14:33,053
Even if I just do this,

340
00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:35,091
and if it looks complete from far away,

341
00:14:35,126 --> 00:14:36,306
it will be a success.

342
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,565
But at that point, the description

343
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,145
would just be the sub element.

344
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:42,228
Rather than betting your life on the sub-elements,

345
00:14:42,253 --> 00:14:44,619
and making the form distorted,

346
00:14:44,963 --> 00:14:46,791
it's better to exclude some of the descriptions

347
00:14:46,815 --> 00:14:48,878
and put them in areas that you want to highlight.

348
00:14:48,902 --> 00:14:50,933
So, likewise, you can draw the best picture

349
00:14:51,032 --> 00:14:53,890
you can with your current drawing skills.

350
00:14:55,093 --> 00:14:57,374
In other words, if you're still not good at describing,

351
00:14:57,384 --> 00:14:58,443
then you don't have to

352
00:14:58,454 --> 00:15:01,104
forcefully increase the amount of description.

353
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:04,067
So, people usually ask me

354
00:15:04,091 --> 00:15:05,485
how should they describe a character

355
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:06,733
and how they should touch it up.

356
00:15:06,757 --> 00:15:07,951
I get a lot of questions like this.

357
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:09,687
But, touching up a drawing

358
00:15:09,712 --> 00:15:11,772
has similarities with the actual drawing process.

359
00:15:11,796 --> 00:15:13,024
So, your skills won't increase

360
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:14,622
right at once.

361
00:15:14,757 --> 00:15:16,896
We'll see this later on and

362
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,382
I'll explain it further then.

363
00:15:18,406 --> 00:15:20,106
But I normally call it brush power.

364
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:22,828
If you want to master

365
00:15:24,128 --> 00:15:25,476
brush power,

366
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,984
you can say that it takes around a few years.

367
00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:30,828
It's something you need to learn naturally as you draw,

368
00:15:30,852 --> 00:15:33,862
so, for now, just learn that

369
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,523
you will come to acquire the necessary skills later on.

370
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,218
Don't focus too much on things like

371
00:15:37,242 --> 00:15:39,101
gradation and description.

372
00:15:39,164 --> 00:15:42,054
When you want to express a drawing,

373
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:43,554
especially a specialized drawing,

374
00:15:43,578 --> 00:15:45,875
when you just use the lighting well,

375
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:48,718
you can make your drawing look complete.

376
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,170
In fact, right now,

377
00:15:50,194 --> 00:15:52,578
I didn't put in too much description.

378
00:15:52,603 --> 00:15:54,726
I only gave light to the top.

379
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,976
But wouldn't it be hard to

380
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,437
call it a proper description?

381
00:15:58,803 --> 00:16:00,320
That's all I described.

382
00:16:00,344 --> 00:16:01,668
That's it.

383
00:16:01,692 --> 00:16:02,507
There's nothing special.

384
00:16:02,531 --> 00:16:03,867
You can even count

385
00:16:04,148 --> 00:16:05,421
the creases on the clothes.

386
00:16:05,445 --> 00:16:06,804
I think maybe I drew around five.

387
00:16:08,116 --> 00:16:09,466
So, even if I drew around that much,

388
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:11,515
the overall form of the illustration will be settled.

389
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:13,539
I don't even need more creases for this area.

390
00:16:13,874 --> 00:16:15,326
It's not where you want to show it, right?

391
00:16:16,412 --> 00:16:18,257
If you can just clearly show

392
00:16:18,281 --> 00:16:19,711
this top area, which is the area we want to show,

393
00:16:19,735 --> 00:16:21,867
you don't need to describe the rest of the illustration.

394
00:16:22,832 --> 00:16:23,895
Remember that

395
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:25,296
they're the additional elements.

396
00:16:25,661 --> 00:16:27,047
Please don't forget that.

397
00:16:27,951 --> 00:16:30,662
I was talking about contrast before.

398
00:16:30,686 --> 00:16:32,850
I think I told you that

399
00:16:33,001 --> 00:16:35,231
when there's the Cast Shadow and the Form Shadow,

400
00:16:35,255 --> 00:16:37,722
the Cast Shadow is the shadow between objects.

401
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:40,000
The Form Shadow forms because of

402
00:16:40,024 --> 00:16:42,196
the object's three-dimensional form.

403
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,702
That's what I said.

404
00:16:43,726 --> 00:16:45,627
I also explained

405
00:16:45,651 --> 00:16:47,945
that because Form Shadow has less contrast

406
00:16:47,969 --> 00:16:49,952
than a Cast Shadow,

407
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:53,333
people usually work on Cast Shadow first.

408
00:16:53,357 --> 00:16:54,945
That's what I said.

409
00:16:57,447 --> 00:16:59,632
With creases on clothes,

410
00:16:59,656 --> 00:17:01,053
they are actually

411
00:17:01,064 --> 00:17:03,569
a mixture of Cast Shadow and Form Shadow.

412
00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:05,371
For example,

413
00:17:06,013 --> 00:17:07,871
there are creases on the shirt,

414
00:17:10,324 --> 00:17:12,267
like this one on the shirt.

415
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,692
For deep creases on clothes, when the light comes in,

416
00:17:16,716 --> 00:17:18,049
there will be shadows.

417
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,392
This won't create a shadow like that.

418
00:17:20,565 --> 00:17:22,132
So in this case, Form Shadow,

419
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,922
if it sticks out like this,

420
00:17:23,946 --> 00:17:25,314
Cast Shadow is applied.

421
00:17:25,338 --> 00:17:26,500
Of course, that works like that.

422
00:17:26,524 --> 00:17:27,985
But let's take a look at this.

423
00:17:28,712 --> 00:17:29,775
This one doesn't protrude up

424
00:17:29,785 --> 00:17:31,181
that much.

425
00:17:31,275 --> 00:17:33,674
The amount of light on this side and that side,

426
00:17:33,698 --> 00:17:35,698
has no dramatic difference.

427
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:37,303
Unless...

428
00:17:40,849 --> 00:17:42,601
So in a case like this,

429
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:43,688
it's important to express the creases,

430
00:17:44,017 --> 00:17:45,366
applying low contrast,

431
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,274
to make it so that there's not much difference.

432
00:17:53,368 --> 00:17:55,323
Just like this,

433
00:17:55,334 --> 00:17:56,355
adjust it gently.

434
00:17:56,911 --> 00:17:58,081
If there's low contrast,

435
00:17:58,105 --> 00:17:59,509
when you look at it in black and white,

436
00:17:59,596 --> 00:18:01,348
the difference between bright and dark parts

437
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:03,323
has to be tiny.

438
00:18:06,066 --> 00:18:07,136
When you look at it like this,

439
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,628
it'd be good if the difference

440
00:18:08,652 --> 00:18:10,077
between the bright and dark parts come out less.

441
00:18:17,861 --> 00:18:19,294
It looks like this.

442
00:18:19,305 --> 00:18:20,581
But the background gets dark,

443
00:18:20,612 --> 00:18:23,060
and just by making the middle part stand out,

444
00:18:23,077 --> 00:18:24,452
the illustration already gets

445
00:18:24,476 --> 00:18:26,263
more intense to some extent.

446
00:18:26,478 --> 00:18:28,422
Of course, I won't finish it here.

447
00:18:41,064 --> 00:18:42,350
I said that

448
00:18:42,374 --> 00:18:45,253
I'd put some highlights on the outer edge

449
00:18:45,278 --> 00:18:48,260
to show you a few of the gazes,

450
00:18:48,284 --> 00:18:49,951
but that doesn't seem to be honest.

451
00:18:49,975 --> 00:18:51,019
So far,

452
00:18:52,636 --> 00:18:54,652
what else can I use at this point?

453
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:56,023
At this point as well.

454
00:18:56,047 --> 00:18:57,607
Let's think about it.

455
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,697
An element that gives you a strong impression.

456
00:19:00,721 --> 00:19:02,181
It shouldn't be too cute.

457
00:19:02,551 --> 00:19:04,005
Then,

458
00:19:04,016 --> 00:19:05,483
what elements can I use?

459
00:19:05,706 --> 00:19:07,777
I think there might be a liquid.

460
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:09,738
Because the character uses tentacles,

461
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:11,876
we can make

462
00:19:12,957 --> 00:19:15,285
liquid flow around its tentacle.

463
00:19:28,616 --> 00:19:30,547
We can make the liquid sticky

464
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,422
over here.

465
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:38,842
Or, I can just

466
00:19:38,853 --> 00:19:40,212
draw an eye over here

467
00:19:40,236 --> 00:19:41,246
in the mouth.

468
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,627
Then, it would look scary overall.

469
00:19:44,638 --> 00:19:47,053
These elements would look good.

470
00:19:48,035 --> 00:19:50,512
I can put in these elements around it too.

471
00:19:58,091 --> 00:19:59,361
Scary, right?

472
00:20:04,576 --> 00:20:06,629
Let's work on it by increasing

473
00:20:07,192 --> 00:20:08,390
these kinds of things.

474
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,573
On the bottom of the background,

475
00:20:18,037 --> 00:20:19,491
draw something like this,

476
00:20:24,861 --> 00:20:26,721
to make it look like blood,

477
00:20:26,745 --> 00:20:27,769
so that we could express

478
00:20:28,775 --> 00:20:30,571
the violence

479
00:20:30,595 --> 00:20:32,921
of the character.

480
00:20:32,945 --> 00:20:34,654
Let's put them in place like this.

481
00:20:40,941 --> 00:20:43,485
So that the middle part of the eye can be a point,

482
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:46,127
use the eye makeup that we used

483
00:20:46,364 --> 00:20:47,881
when we were working on the calm character.

484
00:20:59,991 --> 00:21:01,843
You can see that

485
00:21:01,854 --> 00:21:02,916
the overall makeup we used

486
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,076
is similar to a calm character.

487
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,226
But, even so,

488
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,946
you should use the methods you used for creating a cute character too.

489
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,757
That way, we can make it have a strong impact.

490
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:13,399
For a strong impact,

491
00:21:13,423 --> 00:21:15,648
make sure the viewers focus on a certain area.

492
00:21:15,672 --> 00:21:17,284
Oh, this is where the viewers would focus.

493
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,230
You should decide things like that.

494
00:21:19,254 --> 00:21:21,780
Other than that area, the viewers shouldn't be focusing on the other areas.

495
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,029
But, there should be a strong contrast.

496
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,134
It should overall be bright.

497
00:21:27,571 --> 00:21:29,977
That way, the main element

498
00:21:30,001 --> 00:21:31,929
will give a strong impression.

499
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,990
So, if you look at the difference,

500
00:21:35,014 --> 00:21:37,263
when you show a cute character,

501
00:21:37,287 --> 00:21:39,188
overall, it has an exciting feeling.

502
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,299
You should make it look exciting.

503
00:21:47,323 --> 00:21:48,634
This is the main area.

504
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,874
These areas are additional areas.

505
00:21:53,899 --> 00:21:55,480
So, when you express them,

506
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,246
you should highlight the main area,

507
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,864
but you also have to highlight the additional areas.

508
00:22:00,888 --> 00:22:02,888
Let's say 0 is around here.

509
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:05,010
Then, if you're drawing a calm character,

510
00:22:05,586 --> 00:22:07,987
you won't describe the parts that you won't highlight.

511
00:22:08,011 --> 00:22:09,742
Of course, you need to highlight some areas.

512
00:22:09,766 --> 00:22:11,382
But, these areas won't be that strong.

513
00:22:11,406 --> 00:22:13,442
That way, it will be overall calm.

514
00:22:14,388 --> 00:22:15,416
The main area.

515
00:22:16,618 --> 00:22:18,494
With a character with a strong impression,

516
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:19,514
you won't highlight

517
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:21,240
the areas that you shouldn't highlight.

518
00:22:21,264 --> 00:22:22,710
I'll dramatically highlight the parts I want to highlight.

519
00:22:22,734 --> 00:22:24,507
Other areas won't be highlighted.

520
00:22:25,321 --> 00:22:26,339
Main area.

521
00:22:26,818 --> 00:22:28,264
There's this difference.

522
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,260
So, if you decide

523
00:22:30,285 --> 00:22:32,064
how much you'll highlight certain areas,

524
00:22:32,088 --> 00:22:33,868
your final result will be closer

525
00:22:33,892 --> 00:22:35,203
to the image you want.

526
00:22:47,044 --> 00:22:49,685
I'm going to add some liquid to the hat.

527
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,436
I'll make the overall gaze

528
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,868
flow downwards.

529
00:22:53,892 --> 00:22:56,183
But, I'm going to maintain the character's calm gaze.

530
00:22:56,513 --> 00:22:58,428
I want to give it a cold feeling.

531
00:22:58,615 --> 00:23:01,029
If I wanted to make this illustration feel powerful,

532
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,229
I would have used a gaze that flows from bottom to top.

533
00:23:04,552 --> 00:23:06,698
But if I use that kind of gaze flow,

534
00:23:06,722 --> 00:23:08,557
I won't be able to

535
00:23:08,581 --> 00:23:10,149
create a mood

536
00:23:10,173 --> 00:23:12,057
where the character looks extremely calm.

537
00:23:12,081 --> 00:23:13,563
So, I'll just use the gaze

538
00:23:13,587 --> 00:23:15,487
that goes downwards.

539
00:23:15,675 --> 00:23:17,101
The shape itself

540
00:23:17,126 --> 00:23:19,294
looks like a triangle.

541
00:23:19,318 --> 00:23:22,164
So, this object will make

542
00:23:22,175 --> 00:23:23,585
the gaze go down.

543
00:23:28,308 --> 00:23:29,948
Depending on your directing skills,

544
00:23:29,959 --> 00:23:31,369
you can put these in, too.

545
00:23:36,363 --> 00:23:38,701
It's okay to add them in bit by bit.

546
00:23:38,924 --> 00:23:40,886
So, I can put it in like this.

547
00:23:40,911 --> 00:23:43,226
But, if this becomes too much,

548
00:23:43,626 --> 00:23:45,520
the overall mood could change.

549
00:23:45,885 --> 00:23:47,367
Let's add just a little bit.

550
00:23:50,309 --> 00:23:52,246
It'd be nice to have some fog.

551
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,871
I'll spray it.

552
00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:55,819
I'll use the Eraser tool, too.

553
00:23:58,617 --> 00:24:00,617
I'm going to use a fun method here.

554
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:03,570
I don't want to just use it like this.

555
00:24:04,338 --> 00:24:05,769
So,

556
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:07,759
see this paint can on the left?

557
00:24:07,783 --> 00:24:09,860
If you look at the bottom, there is the Smudge Tool.

558
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:11,451
But,

559
00:24:11,475 --> 00:24:12,559
you can use it as another function.

560
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:14,171
Some people see it as a Blur Tool.

561
00:24:14,195 --> 00:24:15,954
Please change this to the Smudge Tool.

562
00:24:16,481 --> 00:24:18,922
This Smudge Tool pushes things out.

563
00:24:18,946 --> 00:24:21,103
It's like pushing something with our hands.

564
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,810
The downside is that it uses up

565
00:24:24,834 --> 00:24:26,309
too much of your computer's memory.

566
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:27,893
So, if your computer has low memory,

567
00:24:27,917 --> 00:24:30,045
be careful when you use it.

568
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:31,671
If you make a mistake, the file could be erased.

569
00:24:31,695 --> 00:24:33,589
So, it's good to save periodically as you're working.

570
00:24:33,613 --> 00:24:35,861
So I drew some fog around it.

571
00:24:35,885 --> 00:24:38,560
That Smudge Tool is the best tool to edit this form.

572
00:24:39,791 --> 00:24:41,493
It's hard to draw while erasing everything.

573
00:24:41,517 --> 00:24:42,708
It's a bit uncomfortable.

574
00:24:43,739 --> 00:24:46,046
Like this, I'll create a fog

575
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,516
that lurks at the bottom.

576
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,469
It brings out the dreary atmosphere.

577
00:24:49,585 --> 00:24:50,925
And for the gaze,

578
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:52,239
I'll make it

579
00:24:52,852 --> 00:24:54,277
go to the bottom.

580
00:24:55,365 --> 00:24:58,326
Make the gaze go right and left.

581
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:59,549
For the overall composition,

582
00:24:59,573 --> 00:25:01,167
I'm going to use a triangular composition

583
00:25:01,191 --> 00:25:03,248
that we learned before.

584
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:07,099
Using the overall triangular silhouette,

585
00:25:07,585 --> 00:25:09,890
I'll arrange it

586
00:25:09,914 --> 00:25:12,295
so that the gaze goes downwards

587
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:13,667
to create a calm image.

588
00:25:24,761 --> 00:25:26,889
Let's use what we used before.

589
00:25:26,913 --> 00:25:29,264
We used this briefly for creating cute characters.

590
00:25:30,105 --> 00:25:31,993
Remember when we used the Fade Out effect?

591
00:25:32,018 --> 00:25:34,020
As I said before, with this illustration,

592
00:25:34,044 --> 00:25:36,696
the viewers need to focus on the middle part.

593
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,113
As such, unnecessary sections

594
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:40,601
should be removed.

595
00:25:46,385 --> 00:25:48,419
I'm going to use the Multiply Layer.

596
00:25:50,681 --> 00:25:52,279
Let's create areas

597
00:25:52,303 --> 00:25:53,332
that can't be seen.

598
00:25:54,964 --> 00:25:56,362
When I was creating a cute character,

599
00:25:56,386 --> 00:25:57,544
I applied this lightly.

600
00:25:57,568 --> 00:25:59,409
But, you don't have to apply this lightly now.

601
00:26:00,395 --> 00:26:01,466
When it's bright,

602
00:26:01,491 --> 00:26:02,747
it's actually better.

603
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:29,423
To make the background look more intense,

604
00:26:29,447 --> 00:26:31,501
I'll apply lots of key colors,

605
00:26:31,525 --> 00:26:32,845
and I'll continue.

606
00:26:33,181 --> 00:26:35,506
Because I'm coloring the areas around the character's face,

607
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:37,293
it will be okay to apply it

608
00:26:37,785 --> 00:26:38,933
when it's applied just a bit.

609
00:26:38,957 --> 00:26:41,511
But if you apply it too much, viewers can't focus on the face.

610
00:26:41,535 --> 00:26:43,329
The point is to control the amount of color.

611
00:27:00,334 --> 00:27:03,366
Use it to make the drawing look more intense.

612
00:27:03,487 --> 00:27:05,746
This character's mouth is currently blue.

613
00:27:05,942 --> 00:27:08,636
It has a very unique design with a tongue.

614
00:27:09,285 --> 00:27:10,850
So, I'm going to utilize this

615
00:27:10,874 --> 00:27:12,209
and hang these objects.

616
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,517
It looks as if it's drooling.

617
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:17,352
The impression

618
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,595
will be very intense.

619
00:27:19,154 --> 00:27:20,787
Before and after.

620
00:27:22,149 --> 00:27:24,517
Of course, if I want to give it a serious look,

621
00:27:24,541 --> 00:27:26,392
it's okay to leave these out.

622
00:27:28,076 --> 00:27:30,709
Instead, you can add bloodstains.

623
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:51,732
If you do it like this,

624
00:27:51,756 --> 00:27:53,720
the character will give off

625
00:27:53,744 --> 00:27:55,268
a very strong impression.

626
00:27:55,293 --> 00:27:57,543
I'll display it

627
00:27:57,567 --> 00:27:58,939
with the other illustrations I did before.

628
00:28:14,538 --> 00:28:16,731
These are the three illustrations that we did.

629
00:28:17,109 --> 00:28:18,367
The basics.

630
00:28:18,708 --> 00:28:22,533
Cute, calm, and strong.

631
00:28:22,557 --> 00:28:23,986
You'll be able to see something different

632
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:26,049
from the overall impressions.

633
00:28:26,585 --> 00:28:29,525
Like this, you can create various moods

634
00:28:29,536 --> 00:28:30,653
with illustrations.

635
00:28:30,677 --> 00:28:32,679
Even if it's based on the same sketch,

636
00:28:32,703 --> 00:28:34,703
there's a difference in the mood.

637
00:28:35,044 --> 00:28:37,536
So, it's important to use these

638
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,996
to create the image

639
00:28:39,021 --> 00:28:40,024
and compose it

640
00:28:40,048 --> 00:28:41,846
and express what you've composed.

641
00:28:41,937 --> 00:28:43,736
You should keep practicing like that.

642
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,169
It's very important.

643
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,106
Now that we've done it up to here,

644
00:28:51,131 --> 00:28:52,268
I'm going to create another mood

645
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,247
for this character.

646
00:28:56,271 --> 00:28:58,466
I'm going to use another method this time.

647
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:00,861
Earlier, we created atmospheres

648
00:29:00,885 --> 00:29:02,684
according to the mood we wanted to create.

649
00:29:06,952 --> 00:29:09,351
This time, let's give a reason

650
00:29:09,577 --> 00:29:11,007
that's a bit different from that.

651
00:29:21,331 --> 00:29:24,110
This time, I'm going to create canvases

652
00:29:24,134 --> 00:29:26,866
that become different depending on

653
00:29:27,363 --> 00:29:29,433
the color you want to use,

654
00:29:29,457 --> 00:29:30,590
the lighting you intend to give,

655
00:29:30,614 --> 00:29:32,657
or the background you intend to use.

656
00:29:32,967 --> 00:29:34,033
Background color.

657
00:29:34,043 --> 00:29:36,532
While learning about lighting,

658
00:29:36,557 --> 00:29:39,173
we studied background color.

659
00:29:39,198 --> 00:29:40,881
Now, let's use it

660
00:29:40,905 --> 00:29:41,988
in the actual drawing process.

661
00:29:41,999 --> 00:29:43,006
What kind of backgrounds

662
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,032
are commonly used?

663
00:29:44,056 --> 00:29:45,881
There could be an outdoor background.

664
00:29:45,905 --> 00:29:47,711
Especially, we could use different times of the day

665
00:29:47,735 --> 00:29:50,991
such as morning, afternoon, evening,

666
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:52,444
night, and dusk.

667
00:29:52,469 --> 00:29:54,834
You can use these times roughly.

668
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:57,100
Then, let's see how we can show them

669
00:29:57,124 --> 00:29:58,991
based on the lighting.

670
00:29:59,102 --> 00:30:01,121
Let's edit as we go on.

671
00:30:01,477 --> 00:30:02,793
First of all,

672
00:30:05,218 --> 00:30:06,689
let's say you want to organize

673
00:30:06,714 --> 00:30:08,616
a daytime background.

674
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:11,069
Let's think about the characteristics of daylight.

675
00:30:11,305 --> 00:30:13,215
I'm going to draw the backgrounds.

676
00:30:13,591 --> 00:30:15,183
I'm not going to draw it in detail.

677
00:30:15,749 --> 00:30:17,975
For people who think

678
00:30:17,999 --> 00:30:19,002
it's so hard to draw the background,

679
00:30:19,012 --> 00:30:21,402
then, it'd be good to Photoshop your illustration with a reference.

680
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:24,871
When you use photos,

681
00:30:24,895 --> 00:30:27,126
it'd be nice if you do the filtering as well.

682
00:30:27,151 --> 00:30:28,694
If you click,

683
00:30:29,472 --> 00:30:33,001
[Filter] - [Filter Gallery],

684
00:30:33,607 --> 00:30:34,996
if you click in here,

685
00:30:35,102 --> 00:30:37,277
a Photoshop window pops up,

686
00:30:37,931 --> 00:30:39,064
things like this come up,

687
00:30:39,088 --> 00:30:40,975
and there are many effects.

688
00:30:41,196 --> 00:30:42,543
Try to control anything,

689
00:30:42,568 --> 00:30:44,121
find the effect that you want,

690
00:30:44,155 --> 00:30:45,340
and apply it.

691
00:30:46,009 --> 00:30:48,486
By using that to edit the photos,

692
00:30:48,511 --> 00:30:50,407
you can make it as the background of your illustration.

693
00:30:50,785 --> 00:30:51,911
First of all,

694
00:30:51,935 --> 00:30:53,470
I'll draw one and use it.

695
00:30:54,591 --> 00:30:56,027
Let's set it up to be outside

696
00:30:56,051 --> 00:30:58,152
on a sunny day.

697
00:30:59,404 --> 00:31:01,340
There are clouds,

698
00:31:12,065 --> 00:31:13,857
and although it doesn't fit the character,

699
00:31:13,881 --> 00:31:16,098
you can imagine that this character went out on a picnic.

700
00:31:20,888 --> 00:31:23,030
I'll make the floor look like asphalt.

701
00:31:40,907 --> 00:31:41,955
Something like this.

702
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:43,384
It becomes a bright background.

703
00:31:43,409 --> 00:31:45,348
Let's think about the conditions of daylight.

704
00:31:45,372 --> 00:31:47,072
What color is the sunlight?

705
00:31:47,096 --> 00:31:48,419
Actually, the sunlight

706
00:31:48,444 --> 00:31:50,145
is called white light.

707
00:31:50,169 --> 00:31:52,354
It includes all kinds of colors.

708
00:31:52,378 --> 00:31:53,696
But among them,

709
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,499
it's a bit on the yellowish side.

710
00:31:56,524 --> 00:31:58,476
If you look at pictures of the sun in space,

711
00:31:58,501 --> 00:32:00,212
it's burning yellow.

712
00:32:00,237 --> 00:32:01,754
So much so that,

713
00:32:01,778 --> 00:32:03,072
to a certain extent,

714
00:32:03,096 --> 00:32:04,223
the yellow light is a bit strong.

715
00:32:04,247 --> 00:32:05,603
So, the sections which are exposed to the sunlight

716
00:32:05,628 --> 00:32:06,702
tend to have

717
00:32:06,726 --> 00:32:08,270
a bit of a reddish color.

718
00:32:09,089 --> 00:32:11,634
So, under the premise that this character

719
00:32:11,659 --> 00:32:13,155
is the area that receives light,

720
00:32:13,179 --> 00:32:15,410
overall, a yellow color

721
00:32:15,435 --> 00:32:16,879
is added to the canvas.

722
00:32:17,606 --> 00:32:18,827
The shadow area,

723
00:32:18,981 --> 00:32:20,686
well, it's different case by case,

724
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:21,837
but basically,

725
00:32:21,861 --> 00:32:23,452
it will have a bluish color.

726
00:32:23,477 --> 00:32:24,638
Why does that happen?

727
00:32:24,662 --> 00:32:26,406
With shadowy areas,

728
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:28,174
less light comes in

729
00:32:28,198 --> 00:32:29,689
compared the lighted areas.

730
00:32:30,192 --> 00:32:31,765
What does that mean?

731
00:32:39,401 --> 00:32:41,052
When there is an object,

732
00:32:41,063 --> 00:32:43,003
there is the lighted area

733
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:44,426
and the areas without light.

734
00:32:45,242 --> 00:32:47,657
The background color is blue

735
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:55,135
and the light color is yellow.

736
00:32:55,906 --> 00:32:57,819
This area here, where it receives strong light,

737
00:32:57,843 --> 00:32:59,644
will have a strong yellowish color.

738
00:32:59,885 --> 00:33:01,089
With the background color,

739
00:33:01,113 --> 00:33:04,164
there is the main light,

740
00:33:05,052 --> 00:33:07,473
and the light that's reflected around it

741
00:33:07,749 --> 00:33:08,986
comes in.

742
00:33:09,815 --> 00:33:11,271
So, it's basically reflected light.

743
00:33:11,471 --> 00:33:13,112
It's been reflected once.

744
00:33:13,137 --> 00:33:14,596
It already

745
00:33:14,621 --> 00:33:16,934
got rid of light from someplace else,

746
00:33:16,959 --> 00:33:18,405
so it's naturally weaker

747
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:20,222
than the strong light coming from the main source.

748
00:33:20,342 --> 00:33:23,337
So, this area, where it is affected a lot by light,

749
00:33:23,361 --> 00:33:24,987
will have the same color

750
00:33:25,011 --> 00:33:26,276
as the light itself.

751
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,551
Understand it like that.

752
00:33:27,575 --> 00:33:30,222
But, there are areas that aren't affected by light.

753
00:33:30,246 --> 00:33:31,560
The shadows.

754
00:33:31,807 --> 00:33:33,713
Because this shadow

755
00:33:33,737 --> 00:33:35,002
isn't affected by the light a lot,

756
00:33:35,026 --> 00:33:36,110
if we put it the other way around,

757
00:33:36,134 --> 00:33:38,415
the light doesn't reach the shadow.

758
00:33:38,439 --> 00:33:39,977
So, it will be more affected by

759
00:33:40,001 --> 00:33:41,662
the background color.

760
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:45,490
If we made this area yellowish,

761
00:33:45,514 --> 00:33:47,428
this light and shadow area

762
00:33:47,453 --> 00:33:48,942
will be more bluish

763
00:33:49,025 --> 00:33:50,910
since that was the background color.

764
00:33:50,934 --> 00:33:52,111
Think of it that way.

765
00:33:52,135 --> 00:33:53,937
Then, why does the outdoor background

766
00:33:53,961 --> 00:33:55,651
have a blue background color?

767
00:33:55,675 --> 00:33:56,823
Well, it's simple.

768
00:33:56,847 --> 00:33:58,195
The sky is blue.

769
00:33:59,532 --> 00:34:01,081
In the air, there are

770
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:02,110
a lot of blue light particles.

771
00:34:02,134 --> 00:34:03,815
So, blue color is reflected.

772
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:04,992
Think of it like that.

773
00:34:05,016 --> 00:34:07,394
So, the shadows in the character,

774
00:34:07,418 --> 00:34:08,727
in other words, these shadows

775
00:34:08,751 --> 00:34:09,865
that we worked on before,

776
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:12,340
become blue.

777
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:21,086
Then, we are now going to apply

778
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,487
the tertiary colors of light and shadow.

779
00:34:22,511 --> 00:34:24,465
When you're applying tertiary colors,

780
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:26,433
just follow the color of the light.

781
00:34:26,458 --> 00:34:28,308
What color was the light?

782
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:30,554
It was a yellowish, reddish color.

783
00:34:32,648 --> 00:34:33,815
I'm going to use

784
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:34,890
a Normal Layer.

785
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:57,116
Like this.

786
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,507
So, we now have

787
00:34:59,249 --> 00:35:01,793
a reddish tertiary color.

788
00:35:08,051 --> 00:35:09,982
So, I described the tertiary color

789
00:35:10,006 --> 00:35:11,320
by using the outer light.

790
00:35:11,345 --> 00:35:12,980
But, if they're in the same amounts,

791
00:35:13,004 --> 00:35:14,254
it won't look pretty.

792
00:35:14,742 --> 00:35:16,261
If you've applied that,

793
00:35:16,286 --> 00:35:17,477
and if you don't like,

794
00:35:17,501 --> 00:35:18,717
you will want to edit it.

795
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:20,167
Then, what can you do?

796
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,803
I'll copy

797
00:35:21,827 --> 00:35:23,751
the same layer in.

798
00:35:24,644 --> 00:35:27,145
Copy the same layer in,

799
00:35:27,169 --> 00:35:28,771
and apply the same effects.

800
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,721
If you see

801
00:35:31,474 --> 00:35:32,911
the top right here,

802
00:35:32,935 --> 00:35:35,026
there's the Opacity slider.

803
00:35:35,311 --> 00:35:36,790
Slide the Opacity

804
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,278
to 0%.

805
00:35:39,322 --> 00:35:40,802
What happens

806
00:35:41,377 --> 00:35:42,682
when you slide it?

807
00:35:42,862 --> 00:35:44,562
The color we colored in disappears,

808
00:35:44,587 --> 00:35:46,974
and only the outer light will stay.

809
00:35:47,593 --> 00:35:48,922
Like this.

810
00:35:49,097 --> 00:35:51,754
What we're going to do now is

811
00:35:51,779 --> 00:35:53,779
right-click on the layer.

812
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,321
If you see here,

813
00:35:57,345 --> 00:35:59,567
you'll see the menu option [Rasterize Layer].

814
00:36:00,044 --> 00:36:01,080
What is this?

815
00:36:01,104 --> 00:36:02,223
This combines

816
00:36:02,248 --> 00:36:03,947
this outer light and the layer underneath it

817
00:36:03,971 --> 00:36:05,265
into one.

818
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:07,280
The opacity is set to 0%.

819
00:36:07,305 --> 00:36:09,098
If I rasterize it,

820
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:12,365
the Layer underneath it disappears

821
00:36:12,389 --> 00:36:14,176
and only the outer light

822
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,801
that we colored on

823
00:36:15,825 --> 00:36:17,985
the outlines will stay.

824
00:36:18,135 --> 00:36:20,040
As an example, I will use the Selection Tool

825
00:36:20,064 --> 00:36:21,207
to select an area like this.

826
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,663
Then, only this outer area

827
00:36:22,688 --> 00:36:23,986
will be selected like this.

828
00:36:26,869 --> 00:36:28,053
Then remember how,

829
00:36:28,077 --> 00:36:29,557
I applied a Multiply Layer?

830
00:36:30,068 --> 00:36:31,530
I'll make it into a Multiply Layer.

831
00:36:31,554 --> 00:36:33,439
If I turn the above Layer on,

832
00:36:34,703 --> 00:36:36,880
then the shadows

833
00:36:36,891 --> 00:36:39,220
and the outer lights will be separated.

834
00:36:39,688 --> 00:36:41,437
And, within the outer light that's been separated,

835
00:36:41,461 --> 00:36:43,522
I will erase the areas I don't like.

836
00:36:50,828 --> 00:36:51,836
Now, over here,

837
00:36:51,847 --> 00:36:52,984
I'll add a new Layer.

838
00:36:53,008 --> 00:36:54,444
This time, I'm going to apply

839
00:36:54,785 --> 00:36:56,285
the Overlay effect.

840
00:36:56,944 --> 00:36:59,591
I said I was going to give it a yellow color, right?

841
00:37:03,252 --> 00:37:05,011
In the areas that receive light,

842
00:37:06,177 --> 00:37:07,300
I'm going to make sure

843
00:37:07,324 --> 00:37:09,113
that a bright yellow light comes in.

844
00:37:16,385 --> 00:37:18,243
On the other hand, the areas that don't receive light

845
00:37:18,399 --> 00:37:20,241
will receive some blue light.

846
00:37:21,977 --> 00:37:24,308
Especially, we learned that for the background objects

847
00:37:24,332 --> 00:37:25,568
an air perspective is applied,

848
00:37:25,592 --> 00:37:26,744
in the previous lecture.

849
00:37:26,768 --> 00:37:29,551
When we apply that,

850
00:37:29,576 --> 00:37:30,603
we add a lot of the air color.

851
00:37:30,613 --> 00:37:32,819
So, in this case, we would add in a lot of blue.

852
00:37:36,455 --> 00:37:38,121
Make sure to apply bluish colors

853
00:37:38,779 --> 00:37:39,823
to the hair.

854
00:37:39,847 --> 00:37:41,133
It's a good area, right?

855
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,808
Like this.

856
00:38:08,604 --> 00:38:10,151
Because it gets sunlight,

857
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:11,745
it would be natural that

858
00:38:11,769 --> 00:38:12,904
the amount of shadow decreases.

859
00:38:16,203 --> 00:38:17,467
If I do this,

860
00:38:17,491 --> 00:38:19,148
it will be an illustration

861
00:38:19,173 --> 00:38:20,597
that receives strong sunlight.

862
00:38:22,375 --> 00:38:24,314
Now, I'll add other lights too.

863
00:38:27,669 --> 00:38:29,181
This is example number 1.

864
00:38:33,772 --> 00:38:35,128
Now, I'm going to make

865
00:38:35,152 --> 00:38:36,364
an evening background

866
00:38:36,388 --> 00:38:37,848
with a sunset.

867
00:38:45,214 --> 00:38:46,802
When we add sunset,

868
00:38:46,862 --> 00:38:49,079
the blue background color that we looked at before,

869
00:38:49,103 --> 00:38:50,386
will be spread out like this.

870
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:52,868
When there's sunset, the sky is usually orange.

871
00:38:52,892 --> 00:38:54,463
With the evening sky,

872
00:38:54,487 --> 00:38:56,696
the sky itself will be an orange color.

873
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,555
So, the background color that is applied to the character

874
00:38:58,579 --> 00:39:00,249
will be changed to a red color.

875
00:39:00,522 --> 00:39:02,182
The light that's coming in is a yellowish color,

876
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:03,834
and the background color is red.

877
00:39:03,858 --> 00:39:05,366
So, the color would overall be uniform.

878
00:39:06,988 --> 00:39:08,814
Let's change the sky color first.

879
00:39:42,636 --> 00:39:43,853
The tentacle in the back

880
00:39:43,877 --> 00:39:45,334
disturbs our eyesight, so I'll exclude it.

881
00:39:50,363 --> 00:39:52,619
So, the overall illustration

882
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,933
will be a piece

883
00:39:55,957 --> 00:39:57,199
with a strong orange color.

884
00:40:01,386 --> 00:40:02,621
Also, the character

885
00:40:02,645 --> 00:40:03,777
will be an overall orangeish color

886
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:04,985
compared to its original color.

887
00:40:05,009 --> 00:40:06,298
So, the original color will be changed a lot.

888
00:40:10,549 --> 00:40:12,303
We learned this previously with lighting, remember?

889
00:40:12,686 --> 00:40:16,329
When a blue object receives yellow light,

890
00:40:16,467 --> 00:40:18,277
there's no color that it can reflect.

891
00:40:26,785 --> 00:40:28,699
With the Color Range tool,

892
00:40:31,855 --> 00:40:33,329
I'll make these areas

893
00:40:37,773 --> 00:40:39,350
very low saturated -

894
00:40:39,374 --> 00:40:42,534
in fact, they'll be a grayish color.

895
00:40:42,558 --> 00:40:43,621
So, this will be my workflow.

896
00:40:45,511 --> 00:40:47,058
Now, I'll apply the shadows.

897
00:40:47,082 --> 00:40:49,949
I want to utilize what I've used before,

898
00:40:49,973 --> 00:40:51,564
but the light direction has changed.

899
00:40:51,588 --> 00:40:53,110
So, I'll apply that change.

900
00:41:02,075 --> 00:41:04,147
I'll make it a bit dark.

901
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:06,517
This one had a bluish color.

902
00:41:07,321 --> 00:41:09,204
So, it doesn't fit this illustration.

903
00:41:09,988 --> 00:41:12,428
I'll make it a bit more reddish.

904
00:41:18,722 --> 00:41:21,168
Now, with this lighted area,

905
00:41:24,071 --> 00:41:25,449
I'll add a new Layer.

906
00:41:25,473 --> 00:41:27,162
I'm going to add a Screen Layer.

907
00:41:28,196 --> 00:41:29,668
This time, the light won't be completely white,

908
00:41:29,692 --> 00:41:31,876
but instead, it will be a yellowish light.

909
00:41:35,653 --> 00:41:36,787
The direction of the light will be

910
00:41:36,811 --> 00:41:39,246
coming from the top left.

911
00:42:02,989 --> 00:42:04,689
I'll adjust the opacity

912
00:42:04,713 --> 00:42:06,767
to make sure I have the brightness I want.

913
00:42:19,402 --> 00:42:21,376
The light that comes right in front of the character

914
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,506
is a very weak light.

915
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:25,402
So, it will be kind of like a Soft Light.

916
00:42:25,426 --> 00:42:27,708
I'll give more light to the character's face

917
00:42:27,732 --> 00:42:28,819
like this.

918
00:42:30,884 --> 00:42:33,157
I'll adjust it so that

919
00:42:33,566 --> 00:42:34,907
the facial area will be emphasized.

920
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:36,980
Let's make it a bit more of an orange color.

921
00:42:46,725 --> 00:42:48,579
If there's light coming in from the top left,

922
00:42:48,603 --> 00:42:49,756
I told you that

923
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,574
you need to observe carefully

924
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:53,564
how the light will come in

925
00:42:53,588 --> 00:42:54,683
and which areas will receive light.

926
00:42:58,434 --> 00:43:00,301
So, when doing that,

927
00:43:00,326 --> 00:43:02,543
it's important to observe the object as its basic form.

928
00:43:03,373 --> 00:43:06,944
You shouldn't perceive it as

929
00:43:06,968 --> 00:43:08,689
a cloth, a skin, or an eye.

930
00:43:09,181 --> 00:43:10,834
Is it headed towards the top left?

931
00:43:10,858 --> 00:43:12,564
Or, is it headed towards the top right?

932
00:43:12,964 --> 00:43:14,341
These aspects

933
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:15,720
are more important.

934
00:43:16,384 --> 00:43:18,015
Because it is all about lighting,

935
00:43:18,026 --> 00:43:19,027
describing the texture

936
00:43:19,038 --> 00:43:20,449
will come in later.

937
00:43:20,702 --> 00:43:22,912
We're not describing the texture now.

938
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:24,898
Just simply think of

939
00:43:25,366 --> 00:43:26,466
whether a certain area

940
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:28,544
receives light or not.

941
00:43:28,569 --> 00:43:30,186
Think of these things.

942
00:43:30,427 --> 00:43:31,855
Because of the arm on the left,

943
00:43:31,866 --> 00:43:33,883
a Cast Shadow would be formed.

944
00:43:38,012 --> 00:43:39,884
There could also be areas

945
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:40,933
covered with hair.

946
00:43:41,899 --> 00:43:43,843
You have to consider these things.

947
00:44:02,936 --> 00:44:05,421
An eyeball also has three-dimensional characteristics.

948
00:44:05,446 --> 00:44:06,851
When it receives the light,

949
00:44:06,875 --> 00:44:07,989
it could shine.

950
00:44:08,133 --> 00:44:09,732
But, the description of the three-dimensional aspects

951
00:44:09,756 --> 00:44:11,756
will have less deformers applied to it.

952
00:44:12,503 --> 00:44:14,661
Because there are less deformers,

953
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:16,539
it will look less casual.

954
00:44:16,563 --> 00:44:18,253
So, you can apply it depending on the situation.

955
00:44:18,277 --> 00:44:20,391
If it looks pretty after you've applied it, use it.

956
00:44:20,415 --> 00:44:21,710
If it doesn't, don't use it.

957
00:44:21,734 --> 00:44:22,772
That's all.

958
00:44:27,801 --> 00:44:29,644
It's good to add tertiary colors as well.

959
00:44:31,654 --> 00:44:33,194
I'll use the outer light

960
00:44:33,218 --> 00:44:34,517
to add in the tertiary colors.

961
00:44:35,175 --> 00:44:36,959
It will be good if these colors

962
00:44:41,854 --> 00:44:44,007
are overall reddish.

963
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:56,863
If the inside of the hair

964
00:44:56,887 --> 00:44:57,973
and if the inside of the clothes

965
00:44:57,998 --> 00:44:59,719
are just cotton,

966
00:44:59,743 --> 00:45:01,404
it will have this color.

967
00:45:01,608 --> 00:45:03,591
But, there will be some modifications.

968
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:05,974
The character's clothing

969
00:45:05,998 --> 00:45:08,850
and the mint color on the hair

970
00:45:08,874 --> 00:45:11,013
is made up of material

971
00:45:11,037 --> 00:45:12,244
that shines.

972
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,983
So, in that case,

973
00:45:17,531 --> 00:45:19,602
it's okay to

974
00:45:19,626 --> 00:45:20,750
apply the colors

975
00:45:22,033 --> 00:45:23,787
of these materials.

976
00:45:23,811 --> 00:45:25,540
But, if you apply them too much,

977
00:45:25,564 --> 00:45:26,848
the impact of the light will be too weak.

978
00:45:26,859 --> 00:45:28,490
So, add in just a little bit.

979
00:45:29,737 --> 00:45:31,204
Make sure of that.

980
00:45:31,866 --> 00:45:32,986
Just little by little.

981
00:45:35,108 --> 00:45:37,610
Just make sure the light impact isn't weak.

982
00:46:18,063 --> 00:46:20,804
If you want to describe the background as well,

983
00:46:20,829 --> 00:46:22,586
and if it is a moody background,

984
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:23,816
you can put in these.

985
00:46:25,153 --> 00:46:26,414
Things like barbed wire.

986
00:46:30,035 --> 00:46:31,580
We can add a warning sign

987
00:46:31,701 --> 00:46:33,792
to the pillars.

988
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:37,767
Draw it

989
00:46:37,791 --> 00:46:39,124
so that it matches

990
00:46:40,574 --> 00:46:41,780
the character's perspective.

991
00:46:44,884 --> 00:46:47,015
In character illustration,

992
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:48,924
the background is the sub element.

993
00:46:51,979 --> 00:46:54,192
So, don't focus too much on it.

994
00:46:56,391 --> 00:46:58,331
But, if you want to show the background,

995
00:46:58,342 --> 00:46:59,422
then,

996
00:46:59,446 --> 00:47:00,823
you should focus on it.

997
00:47:01,146 --> 00:47:02,541
With illustrations,

998
00:47:02,565 --> 00:47:05,135
the subject changes depending on

999
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:08,733
what you want to show.

1000
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:14,694
An illustrator

1001
00:47:14,906 --> 00:47:15,935
is someone

1002
00:47:15,971 --> 00:47:17,823
who depicts things.

1003
00:47:28,524 --> 00:47:30,112
So,

1004
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:33,223
I'll add in some highlights.

1005
00:47:42,385 --> 00:47:44,023
I won't make it too sparkly.

1006
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,621
Because with sunsets,

1007
00:47:47,645 --> 00:47:49,184
the light is subtle.

1008
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:50,755
So, now that we're done,

1009
00:47:50,766 --> 00:47:51,826
we need to do some editing.

1010
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:53,200
I'll create a new Layer.

1011
00:47:54,244 --> 00:47:55,246
I'll use the Overlay function

1012
00:47:55,257 --> 00:47:56,573
this time as well.

1013
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:58,940
I use Overlay often.

1014
00:48:01,871 --> 00:48:03,710
I'm going to make the light spread out,

1015
00:48:04,041 --> 00:48:06,164
on the top left.

1016
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:07,978
I call this

1017
00:48:08,002 --> 00:48:09,841
scattering light.

1018
00:48:10,365 --> 00:48:11,555
Actually, light

1019
00:48:11,579 --> 00:48:13,637
isn't something

1020
00:48:14,445 --> 00:48:16,242
that comes only in places that it should,

1021
00:48:16,253 --> 00:48:17,511
in a logical way.

1022
00:48:17,657 --> 00:48:19,859
It will be reflected all around.

1023
00:48:19,883 --> 00:48:22,231
Since the light source

1024
00:48:22,247 --> 00:48:24,185
is the Sun,

1025
00:48:24,217 --> 00:48:25,806
it's too big to say that it's a dot.

1026
00:48:26,136 --> 00:48:29,581
So, light spreads around the places it reaches.

1027
00:48:29,605 --> 00:48:31,114
So, around the areas that are lighted,

1028
00:48:31,124 --> 00:48:33,009
add Overlay like this,

1029
00:48:33,033 --> 00:48:34,597
and make it bright.

1030
00:48:34,621 --> 00:48:35,994
Then, it will look like

1031
00:48:36,018 --> 00:48:37,814
a more natural, pretty light.

1032
00:48:39,095 --> 00:48:41,560
The overall illustration will be fancier as well.

1033
00:48:46,765 --> 00:48:48,880
So, make sure to

1034
00:48:48,891 --> 00:48:49,897
apply the scattering light.

1035
00:49:03,678 --> 00:49:05,038
So,

1036
00:49:05,461 --> 00:49:08,168
I also described an illustration

1037
00:49:08,193 --> 00:49:09,914
with the sunset light.

1038
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:19,690
Let's draw

1039
00:49:19,714 --> 00:49:20,885
another illustration, too.

1040
00:49:26,918 --> 00:49:28,918
The sunlight that we drew before.

1041
00:49:30,471 --> 00:49:32,502
I'll give it some highlights here.

1042
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,143
The eyes look too scary.

1043
00:49:38,567 --> 00:49:39,569
And the sunset.

1044
00:49:42,048 --> 00:49:43,633
We saw the differences

1045
00:49:43,657 --> 00:49:44,846
between the two situations.

1046
00:49:49,988 --> 00:49:51,500
This time, the background will be set

1047
00:49:55,057 --> 00:49:56,619
at night.

1048
00:50:00,269 --> 00:50:01,734
We applied daylight

1049
00:50:01,758 --> 00:50:03,131
and sunset,

1050
00:50:03,155 --> 00:50:04,758
so, now, it will be a night sky.

1051
00:50:19,232 --> 00:50:20,881
I'll use the Curve Tool

1052
00:50:20,905 --> 00:50:22,136
to make it

1053
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,786
dark.

1054
00:50:27,663 --> 00:50:28,947
Make the character

1055
00:50:29,301 --> 00:50:30,970
dark,

1056
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:32,026
just like this.

1057
00:50:35,266 --> 00:50:37,540
I'll add the blue light, too.

1058
00:50:38,534 --> 00:50:40,578
The mint color of the character

1059
00:50:40,602 --> 00:50:42,490
could become slightly stronger

1060
00:50:42,514 --> 00:50:45,096
than the previous color.

1061
00:50:47,757 --> 00:50:50,569
This is because the blue object

1062
00:50:50,593 --> 00:50:52,205
received blue light.

1063
00:50:52,229 --> 00:50:53,353
So, for this object,

1064
00:50:53,377 --> 00:50:55,717
there's more reflected light.

1065
00:50:55,923 --> 00:50:57,536
So, a stronger light

1066
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,341
will be applied.

1067
00:51:04,046 --> 00:51:06,629
But, it will be blue.

1068
00:51:08,626 --> 00:51:11,316
Mint is closer to a green color,

1069
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:12,401
and green

1070
00:51:13,101 --> 00:51:15,483
is a mixture of yellow and blue.

1071
00:51:21,598 --> 00:51:23,009
Overall, if I edited it

1072
00:51:23,033 --> 00:51:24,372
like this...

1073
00:51:29,584 --> 00:51:31,278
Let's edit

1074
00:51:31,302 --> 00:51:32,367
the tentacles, too.

1075
00:51:50,879 --> 00:51:52,078
Now, I'll add

1076
00:51:52,102 --> 00:51:53,148
more light to it.

1077
00:51:56,493 --> 00:51:58,493
The gray part doesn't have

1078
00:51:58,517 --> 00:52:00,299
a strong blueish color.

1079
00:52:02,695 --> 00:52:04,247
Select this area as well.

1080
00:52:04,275 --> 00:52:05,916
Using the Color Range Tool,

1081
00:52:08,069 --> 00:52:09,382
select, and then,

1082
00:52:09,406 --> 00:52:11,269
I'll apply a bit more blue.

1083
00:52:14,043 --> 00:52:15,977
I want it to feel bright.

1084
00:52:16,413 --> 00:52:17,437
Here,

1085
00:52:17,465 --> 00:52:18,560
I'll make a Layer.

1086
00:52:19,829 --> 00:52:21,462
Since there's darkness overall,

1087
00:52:21,487 --> 00:52:22,929
now we can give it some light.

1088
00:52:22,954 --> 00:52:24,450
Using the Screen Layer,

1089
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:26,618
I'm going to apply some Backlight.

1090
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:27,752
I also told you

1091
00:52:27,763 --> 00:52:29,122
we call this Meme Light.

1092
00:52:33,391 --> 00:52:35,110
It's important to work while

1093
00:52:35,134 --> 00:52:36,769
you think about the areas where the light comes in

1094
00:52:36,793 --> 00:52:38,395
and the areas that don't.

1095
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:55,084
Character and background.

1096
00:52:55,109 --> 00:52:57,068
The character is dark now,

1097
00:52:57,092 --> 00:52:58,326
and the background is dark, too.

1098
00:52:58,350 --> 00:53:00,494
As such, the character and the background

1099
00:53:00,518 --> 00:53:01,660
should be separated.

1100
00:53:01,762 --> 00:53:03,049
You can give it

1101
00:53:04,112 --> 00:53:05,902
some gradation.

1102
00:53:06,403 --> 00:53:09,442
When we were analyzing references,

1103
00:53:09,466 --> 00:53:11,141
we did this part before.

1104
00:53:11,165 --> 00:53:12,750
Do you remember?

1105
00:53:35,841 --> 00:53:38,925
In this case, the area where the light from the back touches

1106
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:40,554
will be the areas

1107
00:53:40,578 --> 00:53:42,324
that I'm painting as the Back Light.

1108
00:53:42,796 --> 00:53:43,828
That means

1109
00:53:43,852 --> 00:53:47,133
all the parts that I'm not applying Back Light to

1110
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:48,457
are in shadow.

1111
00:53:49,063 --> 00:53:50,891
What's a shadow?

1112
00:53:50,915 --> 00:53:52,562
It's a part where there's no light.

1113
00:53:52,586 --> 00:53:55,348
Since this area doesn't get any light,

1114
00:53:55,372 --> 00:53:57,473
you might ask, shouldn't it be just black?

1115
00:53:57,497 --> 00:53:59,183
I explained this part before.

1116
00:53:59,207 --> 00:54:00,539
In this area,

1117
00:54:01,323 --> 00:54:03,019
the light is reflected from the surroundings

1118
00:54:03,785 --> 00:54:07,037
and the background light is coming from all directions.

1119
00:54:07,062 --> 00:54:08,418
So, that's why

1120
00:54:08,442 --> 00:54:09,625
we can see this character.

1121
00:54:09,738 --> 00:54:11,480
If it weren't for that light,

1122
00:54:11,504 --> 00:54:12,793
this character would be black,

1123
00:54:12,817 --> 00:54:14,312
and only the Back Light could be seen.

1124
00:54:14,336 --> 00:54:15,341
To show you an example,

1125
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,500
with only the silhouette,

1126
00:54:19,472 --> 00:54:21,109
it will be like this.

1127
00:54:54,331 --> 00:54:55,417
As expected, with this process

1128
00:54:55,441 --> 00:54:56,761
you can turn off the Pen Pressure.

1129
00:54:59,053 --> 00:55:01,523
If you're only thinking about the area,

1130
00:55:54,896 --> 00:55:56,385
do it like this.

1131
00:55:59,508 --> 00:56:01,107
As expected... the tertiary colors.

1132
00:56:01,131 --> 00:56:03,267
This time, it's not just the orangeish colors.

1133
00:56:03,291 --> 00:56:04,801
It's getting blue light,

1134
00:56:05,176 --> 00:56:07,176
which is the moonlight coming from behind.

1135
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,415
So, the tertiary color will also look a bit blue.

1136
00:56:14,389 --> 00:56:16,173
Let's put it in like this.

1137
00:56:16,231 --> 00:56:17,530
But if I do this,

1138
00:56:17,554 --> 00:56:19,190
the drawing will be too bland.

1139
00:56:19,273 --> 00:56:21,442
Some areas can't be seen clearly.

1140
00:56:21,466 --> 00:56:22,614
It's kind of boring.

1141
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:23,713
From here,

1142
00:56:23,737 --> 00:56:25,097
you need some direction skills.

1143
00:56:25,121 --> 00:56:27,551
When we draw characters with a night background,

1144
00:56:27,575 --> 00:56:29,250
you need to think that the light coming from the front

1145
00:56:29,275 --> 00:56:32,015
has some intensity.

1146
00:56:32,039 --> 00:56:34,750
When I was working on the sunset background,

1147
00:56:34,774 --> 00:56:37,133
I used the light in the middle as Soft Light,

1148
00:56:37,157 --> 00:56:39,593
and I applied some light to the lower part of the face.

1149
00:56:39,617 --> 00:56:40,978
Similarly,

1150
00:56:41,002 --> 00:56:42,224
with the night background,

1151
00:56:42,248 --> 00:56:44,793
I made the bottom look brighter,

1152
00:56:47,645 --> 00:56:49,238
to get some light.

1153
00:56:49,946 --> 00:56:51,139
You can increase

1154
00:56:51,848 --> 00:56:54,364
the density of the light

1155
00:57:10,354 --> 00:57:11,816
to increase

1156
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:13,110
the visible areas.

1157
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,931
People see the bright areas first.

1158
00:57:16,096 --> 00:57:17,839
To put it the other way around,

1159
00:57:17,863 --> 00:57:19,689
it's hard to draw attention

1160
00:57:19,713 --> 00:57:21,091
with dark spaces.

1161
00:57:22,699 --> 00:57:24,477
If this illustration goes wrong,

1162
00:57:24,501 --> 00:57:26,699
it could be an illustration that doesn't have anything to see in it.

1163
00:57:27,429 --> 00:57:28,856
So, to avoid doing that,

1164
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,953
so that the viewers can definitely feel they are seeing something,

1165
00:57:30,977 --> 00:57:33,084
I'll add a lot of highlights.

1166
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:56,769
I'm going to make the eyes have a strong impression.

1167
00:57:56,992 --> 00:57:58,448
I'll show it to you like this.

1168
00:58:00,563 --> 00:58:01,916
Nocturnal animals

1169
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:03,570
have shining eyes at night.

1170
00:58:03,594 --> 00:58:05,874
They actually look really cool.

1171
00:58:05,898 --> 00:58:07,285
You might think they look scary.

1172
00:58:11,152 --> 00:58:14,009
There are a lot of elements like that.

1173
00:58:14,034 --> 00:58:15,115
So, I'll make these elements

1174
00:58:15,139 --> 00:58:17,202
like they're glow-in-the-dark.

1175
00:58:36,936 --> 00:58:38,968
I'll add a lot of highlights.

1176
00:58:47,323 --> 00:58:49,416
To make the drawing look shiny,

1177
00:59:13,888 --> 00:59:15,553
when we put highlights on the hair,

1178
00:59:15,577 --> 00:59:17,202
people often mistake something.

1179
00:59:17,226 --> 00:59:18,964
Let's talk about this first.

1180
00:59:19,292 --> 00:59:20,627
When you want to give it Back Light,

1181
00:59:20,651 --> 00:59:22,055
and when you highlight it,

1182
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:23,713
some people apply it like this.

1183
00:59:25,194 --> 00:59:26,622
You might ask yourself,

1184
00:59:26,633 --> 00:59:27,635
what's wrong with that?

1185
00:59:27,646 --> 00:59:29,657
The character is not receiving

1186
00:59:29,667 --> 00:59:30,835
the light from the left.

1187
00:59:31,856 --> 00:59:33,335
The reason why this character got brighter is

1188
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,742
because it received

1189
00:59:34,766 --> 00:59:36,516
the light from the side and the back light.

1190
00:59:36,541 --> 00:59:38,387
So, that's it for now.

1191
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:41,425
So, this area is the shadow.

1192
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:43,357
The light that this area receives

1193
00:59:43,381 --> 00:59:44,598
is not this light.

1194
00:59:44,773 --> 00:59:46,497
It's not the light that came from the side.

1195
00:59:46,508 --> 00:59:47,588
The light that this part receives

1196
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:49,238
only comes from the front.

1197
00:59:49,262 --> 00:59:50,965
So, as the highlight goes to the left,

1198
00:59:50,989 --> 00:59:52,272
there's no need to get bigger.

1199
00:59:52,325 --> 00:59:53,352
When you color it

1200
00:59:53,376 --> 00:59:55,123
and when you add the density later,

1201
00:59:55,147 --> 00:59:56,703
the more you go to the left,

1202
00:59:56,728 --> 00:59:58,127
there's no need to be bright.

1203
00:59:58,419 --> 01:00:00,514
There are many people who misunderstand this.

1204
01:00:00,538 --> 01:00:01,636
The light that's received here

1205
01:00:01,646 --> 01:00:03,078
only receives the light from the front.

1206
01:00:03,514 --> 01:00:05,460
Only the background light is received.

1207
01:00:05,484 --> 01:00:08,296
So, only the areas that are close to our eyes will get brighter.

1208
01:00:12,693 --> 01:00:14,520
So don't get it wrong.

1209
01:00:17,099 --> 01:00:18,517
People often make mistakes here.

1210
01:00:44,284 --> 01:00:45,457
The tool I'm using right now is

1211
01:00:45,481 --> 01:00:46,504
the Dodge Tool.

1212
01:00:46,528 --> 01:00:48,678
The default shortcut is the O button.

1213
01:00:48,841 --> 01:00:51,359
The tool that uses this button,

1214
01:00:51,384 --> 01:00:52,416
which is the Dodge Tool,

1215
01:00:52,427 --> 01:00:54,759
brightens up the picture.

1216
01:00:55,411 --> 01:00:57,662
If you use it too much, the picture will look like it's burning.

1217
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,418
So, please don't use it too much.

1218
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:02,458
Like this,

1219
01:01:03,397 --> 01:01:05,007
I'll make the middle area

1220
01:01:05,031 --> 01:01:06,208
brighter more effectively.

1221
01:01:07,681 --> 01:01:09,433
I'll apply some more blue.

1222
01:01:10,134 --> 01:01:11,304
Do it like this.

1223
01:01:11,315 --> 01:01:14,286
Since it's nighttime, I said I'm going to add some sparkles.

1224
01:01:14,387 --> 01:01:16,208
That's what I wanted to do.

1225
01:01:16,964 --> 01:01:19,385
I put some sparkles around the character.

1226
01:01:51,872 --> 01:01:54,158
Like this, you can now create

1227
01:01:54,182 --> 01:01:55,764
illustrations with a night sky.

1228
01:01:55,992 --> 01:01:57,820
Let's look at the difference from the previous one,

1229
01:01:57,844 --> 01:01:59,979
and let's see if it looks like night.

1230
01:02:03,417 --> 01:02:04,753
So, let's list the differences.

1231
01:02:54,968 --> 01:02:57,098
With this illustration,

1232
01:02:57,122 --> 01:02:59,009
I made various variations.

1233
01:03:00,487 --> 01:03:02,651
There's a clear difference in the atmosphere.

1234
01:03:03,929 --> 01:03:06,170
If you look at the illustration examples I gave today,

1235
01:03:06,194 --> 01:03:07,487
you can see

1236
01:03:07,511 --> 01:03:09,139
that the time has changed.

1237
01:03:09,484 --> 01:03:12,259
So when you make an illustration like this,

1238
01:03:12,283 --> 01:03:14,029
you need to tailor it to the nuances

1239
01:03:14,053 --> 01:03:15,586
you want to create.

1240
01:03:15,610 --> 01:03:16,987
So if there's a light you want to use,

1241
01:03:17,099 --> 01:03:18,717
with the light direction,

1242
01:03:18,741 --> 01:03:20,919
you can create illustrations according to that.

1243
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:21,993
If you look at this,

1244
01:03:22,017 --> 01:03:24,271
you can see that the mood changed gradually.

1245
01:03:24,282 --> 01:03:25,169
First,

1246
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:27,425
with the bright light, we gave it a cute and warm image.

1247
01:03:27,454 --> 01:03:28,373
For the second one,

1248
01:03:28,397 --> 01:03:29,998
it was a pretty and bright image.

1249
01:03:30,022 --> 01:03:30,944
The third one was

1250
01:03:30,968 --> 01:03:32,232
a strong image.

1251
01:03:32,328 --> 01:03:34,258
Depending on the light you want to use,

1252
01:03:34,282 --> 01:03:35,477
the mood changes.

1253
01:03:35,501 --> 01:03:37,175
So it's important to change the illustration

1254
01:03:37,199 --> 01:03:39,383
depending on the lighting you want to give it.

1255
01:03:40,974 --> 01:03:41,988
Like this,

1256
01:03:41,999 --> 01:03:43,831
with one illustration,

1257
01:03:44,381 --> 01:03:46,467
we drew them in different types.

1258
01:03:47,022 --> 01:03:49,343
What I want to say to you

1259
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:51,415
once more is,

1260
01:03:55,324 --> 01:03:57,324
just because I emphasized light,

1261
01:03:57,348 --> 01:04:00,045
don't be too obsessed with it.

1262
01:04:00,573 --> 01:04:01,627
What am I trying to say?

1263
01:04:01,638 --> 01:04:03,738
Drawing is something that can be done freely.

1264
01:04:03,763 --> 01:04:04,878
Especially with casual drawings,

1265
01:04:04,902 --> 01:04:06,290
you can draw

1266
01:04:06,314 --> 01:04:07,571
much more freely.

1267
01:04:07,596 --> 01:04:10,368
Because of that, you can direct it like...

1268
01:04:23,342 --> 01:04:24,461
for example,

1269
01:04:32,083 --> 01:04:34,483
by changing the background to purple.

1270
01:04:34,929 --> 01:04:36,160
Make the areas

1271
01:04:36,185 --> 01:04:37,509
such as the light and dark parts

1272
01:04:39,517 --> 01:04:40,900
of the character

1273
01:04:47,334 --> 01:04:48,947
like this.

1274
01:05:32,769 --> 01:05:35,017
Overall, it's important that the parts that receive light

1275
01:05:35,041 --> 01:05:36,386
become brighter.

1276
01:05:36,477 --> 01:05:38,863
If it becomes bright in black and white, there's no problem.

1277
01:05:39,214 --> 01:05:41,678
So if it gets brighter when you see it in black and white,

1278
01:05:41,702 --> 01:05:43,569
even if the saturation gets strong,

1279
01:05:43,593 --> 01:05:45,504
it's not that important,

1280
01:05:45,632 --> 01:05:47,166
no matter how the hues change.

1281
01:05:47,330 --> 01:05:48,431
In painting,

1282
01:05:48,632 --> 01:05:50,569
if you think about the picture itself,

1283
01:05:50,593 --> 01:05:52,301
it's not that important.

1284
01:05:54,023 --> 01:05:56,681
When you brightened the middle area like this,

1285
01:05:56,705 --> 01:05:58,416
or change the color like this,

1286
01:06:01,948 --> 01:06:03,779
as long as they suit each other,

1287
01:06:03,803 --> 01:06:05,060
it won't be a problem.

1288
01:06:10,943 --> 01:06:14,201
The way to use this Lasso Tool is,

1289
01:06:14,506 --> 01:06:16,446
you don't even have to use a drawing tablet.

1290
01:06:16,470 --> 01:06:18,488
Sometimes, I just work with a mouse.

1291
01:06:19,933 --> 01:06:22,014
Most of the time, of course, I use a drawing tablet.

1292
01:06:25,410 --> 01:06:27,956
Even if you go in like this, you'll see that

1293
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:30,326
it still becomes an okay illustration.

1294
01:06:30,703 --> 01:06:33,258
In other words, in the illustration,

1295
01:06:33,282 --> 01:06:34,939
the coloring

1296
01:06:34,963 --> 01:06:36,170
is something really free.

1297
01:06:36,246 --> 01:06:38,430
Because of that, you can make many variations

1298
01:06:38,454 --> 01:06:40,290
by yourself like this.

1299
01:06:40,314 --> 01:06:42,050
Even if I draw only one piece of illustration,

1300
01:06:42,074 --> 01:06:44,003
make various examples.

1301
01:06:44,027 --> 01:06:46,109
I'd like to emphasize that

1302
01:06:46,134 --> 01:06:48,191
if you increase the number

1303
01:06:48,215 --> 01:06:49,811
of the type of illustrations you can draw,

1304
01:06:49,835 --> 01:06:51,089
it would be good.

1305
01:06:51,113 --> 01:06:53,019
That's one of the things I'd like to emphasize.

1306
01:06:53,043 --> 01:06:54,837
While talking about coloring,

1307
01:06:55,166 --> 01:06:57,034
there's one last thing I want to say.

1308
01:07:17,202 --> 01:07:19,624
You can control the contrast.

1309
01:07:27,654 --> 01:07:29,432
I'll tell you in the description part,

1310
01:07:29,805 --> 01:07:32,005
but later on,

1311
01:07:33,054 --> 01:07:34,657
you can use

1312
01:07:35,870 --> 01:07:37,405
many editing methods.

1313
01:07:45,355 --> 01:07:46,958
This can also be a way

1314
01:07:46,982 --> 01:07:49,249
of drawing an illustration.

1315
01:07:55,217 --> 01:07:56,479
I'll put it on display.

1316
01:08:01,339 --> 01:08:02,535
So like this,

1317
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:04,727
we learned how to make a full illustration.

1318
01:08:05,385 --> 01:08:07,797
Next time, I'll pick one of these

1319
01:08:07,821 --> 01:08:08,923
that I like the most,

1320
01:08:08,947 --> 01:08:10,821
and I'll tell you

1321
01:08:10,845 --> 01:08:12,204
how to finish it,

1322
01:08:12,228 --> 01:08:13,657
up to the completion stage.

1323
01:08:13,782 --> 01:08:16,331
You will then learn how to

1324
01:08:16,356 --> 01:08:18,211
change the expression depending on the mood.

1325
01:08:18,235 --> 01:08:20,086
It will be good

1326
01:08:20,110 --> 01:08:21,533
if you can choose how to color your illustration

1327
01:08:21,558 --> 01:08:22,857
according to

1328
01:08:22,881 --> 01:08:24,920
what kind of illustration

1329
01:08:24,944 --> 01:08:26,022
you're going for.

1330
01:08:26,033 --> 01:08:28,523
Let's wrap up today's class.

1331
01:08:29,172 --> 01:08:30,467
I'll see you again

1332
01:08:31,083 --> 01:08:32,623
in the next lecture.

1333
01:08:32,625 --> 01:08:33,875
Keep up the great work.
