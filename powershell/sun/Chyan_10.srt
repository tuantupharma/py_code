00:00:06,187 --> 00:00:07,041
Hello.

3
00:00:07,043 --> 00:00:08,808
This is the last chapter of Section 3.

4
00:00:08,833 --> 00:00:12,433
Today, we'll learn about coloring.

5
00:00:12,483 --> 00:00:14,372
In the previous lectures of Section 3,

6
00:00:14,374 --> 00:00:17,704
we learned how to direct the gaze.

7
00:00:17,729 --> 00:00:19,192
We also learned

8
00:00:19,217 --> 00:00:20,434
how to use the silhouette

9
00:00:20,436 --> 00:00:23,296
and learned how to further direct the gaze.

10
00:00:23,321 --> 00:00:24,983
We also utilized those things

11
00:00:25,008 --> 00:00:26,850
to design a character.

12
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,013
Now, in Sections 4 and 5,

13
00:00:30,038 --> 00:00:33,646
we're going to draw an illustration based on a character design.

14
00:00:33,671 --> 00:00:37,929
To do so, you need to understand lighting.

15
00:00:37,931 --> 00:00:40,050
So, I have included this chapter.

16
00:00:40,075 --> 00:00:43,792
Actually, lighting is a very logical concept

17
00:00:43,817 --> 00:00:45,641
and you need to know a lot of theories.

18
00:00:45,933 --> 00:00:49,727
So, it is a bit difficult to understand this concept well.

19
00:00:49,785 --> 00:00:52,077
But, being logical means

20
00:00:52,102 --> 00:00:56,325
there aren't a lot of variables to it.

21
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,542
So, once you've grasped this concept,

22
00:00:59,567 --> 00:01:03,169
you can apply it to colors as well.

23
00:01:03,194 --> 00:01:06,281
So, there are color palettes that people like.

24
00:01:06,331 --> 00:01:08,071
If you memorize those palettes,

25
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,870
or if you simply familiarize yourself with them,

26
00:01:09,872 --> 00:01:14,227
you can use them to create different kinds of

27
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:15,270
illustrations.

28
00:01:15,413 --> 00:01:17,517
So, before we learn coloring,

29
00:01:17,542 --> 00:01:19,092
there's something we need to know in advance.

30
00:01:19,117 --> 00:01:22,464
We need to know about the amount of information.

31
00:01:27,898 --> 00:01:32,096
Actually, this concept doesn't just apply to the lighting.

32
00:01:32,121 --> 00:01:35,435
It applies to all other theories as well.

33
00:01:35,502 --> 00:01:39,037
For example, the amount of information could include

34
00:01:39,154 --> 00:01:40,837
things like

35
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:44,529
if a character's face is detailed

36
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:47,645
or not.

37
00:01:47,813 --> 00:01:50,483
We can also question if the coloring is detailed or simple.

38
00:01:50,508 --> 00:01:52,652
We can also ask if the design is simple or not,

39
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:56,208
or if there are a lot of sub elements.

40
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,177
The amount of information

41
00:01:58,344 --> 00:02:00,508
is like the seasoning on food.

42
00:02:00,575 --> 00:02:02,852
So, the quantity doesn't guarantee quality.

43
00:02:02,877 --> 00:02:05,798
You should put in the right amount for your illustration.

44
00:02:06,277 --> 00:02:07,456
However, I should say that

45
00:02:07,481 --> 00:02:09,823
there should be at least some amount of information.

46
00:02:10,806 --> 00:02:14,788
Unlike animations or comics,

47
00:02:14,813 --> 00:02:16,765
with illustrations, you need to look at a piece for a long time.

48
00:02:16,767 --> 00:02:19,527
So, we need some amount of information

49
00:02:19,552 --> 00:02:20,792
in a piece of drawing

50
00:02:20,817 --> 00:02:24,416
so that the viewers can actually enjoy it.

51
00:02:24,542 --> 00:02:26,194
So, how can we control it

52
00:02:26,808 --> 00:02:30,120
while we are learning coloring?

53
00:02:30,396 --> 00:02:32,902
Well, these are some of the elements we can control.

54
00:02:33,104 --> 00:02:33,921
We can control the saturation,

55
00:02:35,123 --> 00:02:36,092
the density,

56
00:02:38,369 --> 00:02:39,523
the contrast,

57
00:02:43,681 --> 00:02:44,871
and the hue.

58
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,923
Usually, we would control these things.

59
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:52,775
They have literal meanings.

60
00:02:52,892 --> 00:02:54,015
When you look at this Color Picker,

61
00:02:54,615 --> 00:02:56,165
the saturation would be

62
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,931
the horizontal axis on here.

63
00:02:59,956 --> 00:03:03,213
The stronger it gets, the stronger the impression the color gives.

64
00:03:03,423 --> 00:03:05,063
If we see this baby pink color

65
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,041
and this red color together,

66
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:09,783
you can see the red much more easily.

67
00:03:09,967 --> 00:03:12,721
So, the red color would have more information.

68
00:03:13,021 --> 00:03:14,627
The density would be

69
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:17,198
how dense the depiction is.

70
00:03:18,842 --> 00:03:21,493
Let's describe the left dot like this.

71
00:03:21,988 --> 00:03:25,572
And let's describe the right one like this.

72
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:33,756
If there are a lot of colors like this,

73
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:36,275
when we see the left and right dot together,

74
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,998
the right one will be more eye-catching.

75
00:03:38,023 --> 00:03:39,758
So, it's one of the elements that help you

76
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,179
control the amount of information.

77
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:45,447
I actually described the contrast a bit previously,

78
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:48,279
and for this example, I explained the density.

79
00:03:51,187 --> 00:03:54,396
If I just apply the density to this example,

80
00:03:54,798 --> 00:04:00,650
just doing this will make the right dot stand out more.

81
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:06,272
I'll apply the contrast like I did before.

82
00:04:06,297 --> 00:04:08,591
When there's a higher amount of contrast,

83
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:11,343
it will have a higher amount of information.

84
00:04:11,683 --> 00:04:13,329
The same with hues.

85
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:16,181
If you have many different types of hues,

86
00:04:17,933 --> 00:04:20,957
for example, if this red color

87
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,873
keeps on changing like this,

88
00:04:23,198 --> 00:04:25,366
the overall impression would be stronger

89
00:04:25,368 --> 00:04:28,698
compared to the one on the left.

90
00:04:29,815 --> 00:04:31,519
So, if we utilize this, we can control

91
00:04:31,544 --> 00:04:34,241
the amount of information in the coloring stage.

92
00:04:34,308 --> 00:04:39,238
Of course, in the drawing stage,

93
00:04:39,391 --> 00:04:42,319
you would control the amount of information.

94
00:04:42,321 --> 00:04:45,899
But, the coloring has to be in accordance with the drawing.

95
00:04:45,901 --> 00:04:47,613
So, when you modify the coloring,

96
00:04:47,638 --> 00:04:50,495
you use these to control the

97
00:04:50,497 --> 00:04:51,975
amount of information.

98
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,550
This is the key point

99
00:04:53,562 --> 00:04:55,938
of the coloring theory that we're learning today.

100
00:05:01,688 --> 00:05:05,800
I said before that the amount of information

101
00:05:05,825 --> 00:05:06,938
is like adding spice.

102
00:05:06,963 --> 00:05:10,752
We say that a food is bland if there's no spice.

103
00:05:10,985 --> 00:05:14,526
But, if it becomes a bit more salty, we say

104
00:05:14,528 --> 00:05:15,575
that it is savory.

105
00:05:16,075 --> 00:05:17,667
If it becomes even more salty,

106
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:19,417
we would think it's too salty.

107
00:05:19,973 --> 00:05:21,663
But, if the salty flavor itself

108
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:24,325
is the main flavor, we would say it has

109
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,554
just the right amount of salt.

110
00:05:25,704 --> 00:05:27,998
But if it becomes overly salty, we won't enjoy it.

111
00:05:28,181 --> 00:05:32,569
So, you can see that there's the right amount of seasoning when cooking.

112
00:05:32,594 --> 00:05:35,085
There are illustrations with little information

113
00:05:35,098 --> 00:05:36,321
that are easy to look at from the first glance.

114
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:39,204
So, the coloring method for simple illustrations

115
00:05:39,217 --> 00:05:40,858
and the coloring method

116
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:43,481
for more complex illustrations

117
00:05:43,506 --> 00:05:46,204
that are more detailed

118
00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:47,333
would be different.

119
00:05:47,592 --> 00:05:49,833
So, the composition you want to show

120
00:05:49,858 --> 00:05:52,696
would depend on how you create it.

121
00:05:52,721 --> 00:05:55,150
So, keep that in mind.

122
00:05:55,192 --> 00:05:57,738
Here, we have a lot of coloring methods.

123
00:05:57,763 --> 00:06:02,719
Depending on the lighting, the coloring style

124
00:06:02,744 --> 00:06:05,939
or the skin tone would change drastically.

125
00:06:06,704 --> 00:06:09,756
For example, the skin here

126
00:06:09,781 --> 00:06:11,975
and the skin here have very different colors.

127
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,848
We have this information,

128
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,396
but, actually, we can't learn it if we just look at it.

129
00:06:16,421 --> 00:06:19,308
So, let's get into the actual practice today.

130
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:22,408
I have the same character from previous examples.

131
00:06:22,608 --> 00:06:25,198
I'm going to give it some lighting.

132
00:06:27,035 --> 00:06:29,081
I'll explain a lot of things,

133
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,665
so let's move on!

134
00:06:31,981 --> 00:06:34,023
I'll use the Multiply Layer

135
00:06:34,048 --> 00:06:36,508
and clip it to the illustration.

136
00:06:43,748 --> 00:06:47,268
I previously mentioned that you can control the amount of information with coloring.

137
00:06:47,344 --> 00:06:50,539
This character has a very bland design.

138
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,390
It's only wearing a swimsuit,

139
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,848
so it looks bland.

140
00:06:53,873 --> 00:06:56,987
Later on, I'm going to dress up this character too.

141
00:06:57,396 --> 00:06:59,873
When you're coloring a bland character,

142
00:06:59,898 --> 00:07:02,300
and you want to make a strong impression,

143
00:07:02,325 --> 00:07:04,163
you can simply just do that.

144
00:07:04,188 --> 00:07:05,777
But if you want to also

145
00:07:05,802 --> 00:07:08,238
give a good impression to the viewers,

146
00:07:08,263 --> 00:07:12,291
you need to also increase the amount of information it has.

147
00:07:12,496 --> 00:07:13,779
Then, how can we increase it

148
00:07:13,804 --> 00:07:15,794
while we're coloring?

149
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:19,512
We can control the light and shadows.

150
00:07:19,888 --> 00:07:22,088
The parts that are shadowy

151
00:07:22,113 --> 00:07:23,727
are called the dark areas.

152
00:07:24,394 --> 00:07:27,679
So, if there are more shadows,

153
00:07:27,704 --> 00:07:29,396
there would be more information.

154
00:07:34,305 --> 00:07:35,154
That is why

155
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,979
if you want to emphasize the character's skin,

156
00:07:38,023 --> 00:07:40,638
it will be effective to just

157
00:07:40,663 --> 00:07:42,269
increase the amount of shadows.

158
00:07:42,294 --> 00:07:43,406
How would we do that?

159
00:07:43,431 --> 00:07:45,415
Should I give it light from the front?

160
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,915
If I do that,

161
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,560
the light would go to the character's side.

162
00:07:50,254 --> 00:07:53,135
Because it will go sideways,

163
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,315
there won't be much shadow.

164
00:07:56,073 --> 00:07:57,879
So, this illustration would give a strong impression.

165
00:07:57,904 --> 00:07:59,478
That's not what we're aiming for.

166
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,521
Then, you can set the direction of the light

167
00:08:01,546 --> 00:08:03,010
so that it would be more shadowy.

168
00:08:03,035 --> 00:08:05,029
Instead of putting light from the front,

169
00:08:05,054 --> 00:08:08,133
give it light from the top, the bottom

170
00:08:08,158 --> 00:08:10,994
or from the side. That's how it's normally done.

171
00:08:15,198 --> 00:08:17,104
If you give it light from the side,

172
00:08:29,206 --> 00:08:35,051
overall, it will look lonely,

173
00:08:35,053 --> 00:08:36,590
and we can give it more information.

174
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:51,413
It's good to make the shadow wide in this process.

175
00:08:51,438 --> 00:08:53,019
I'll make one leg go backwards more.

176
00:08:53,781 --> 00:08:55,546
I'll apply a lot of shadows to it.

177
00:09:15,796 --> 00:09:18,235
Change the hues for each part

178
00:09:23,781 --> 00:09:26,308
so that it goes along with the other parts.

179
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,262
I'll also adjust the contrast.

180
00:09:29,398 --> 00:09:32,306
If you want more information, increase the contrast,

181
00:09:32,397 --> 00:09:35,479
and if you want less information, decrease it.

182
00:09:36,046 --> 00:09:37,429
That's how you would balance the whole thing.

183
00:09:38,696 --> 00:09:40,660
If the color becomes lighter,

184
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,419
there would be less information.

185
00:09:45,569 --> 00:09:47,262
Adjust the amount of information

186
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:50,106
so that you get an illustration

187
00:09:50,108 --> 00:09:51,323
to your liking.

188
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,826
That's how you control the amount of information in coloring.

189
00:09:54,231 --> 00:09:56,700
Depending on the amount of information you want to give,

190
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,235
control the angle of the lighting

191
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,519
to increase or decrease the shadows.

192
00:10:01,933 --> 00:10:06,633
You can additionally control the saturation, the contrast

193
00:10:08,223 --> 00:10:10,848
and the density of the shadows.

194
00:10:10,925 --> 00:10:14,056
Density means how much the elements are gathered together.

195
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:16,963
If there are a lot of small shadows,

196
00:10:16,988 --> 00:10:18,545
the density would increase.

197
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:20,933
If you split up the shadows

198
00:10:26,802 --> 00:10:27,963
or if you do this,

199
00:10:27,988 --> 00:10:31,383
you can see a clear difference from the previous one.

200
00:10:31,408 --> 00:10:32,269
Before,

201
00:10:32,294 --> 00:10:32,931
and after.

202
00:10:32,956 --> 00:10:35,206
If you look at it from far away, you'll see that

203
00:10:35,231 --> 00:10:36,844
the second one has a stronger first impression.

204
00:10:38,102 --> 00:10:40,531
So, when you want to give a lot of information to the viewers

205
00:10:40,532 --> 00:10:43,769
while still keeping the character design simple,

206
00:10:43,781 --> 00:10:46,888
you can increase the information through coloring.

207
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:48,650
That's the key point of today's lecture.

208
00:10:53,223 --> 00:10:55,138
You can increase it even more drastically.

209
00:10:55,163 --> 00:10:57,708
Let's give it light from the top.

210
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,246
If you do this dramatically,

211
00:11:48,277 --> 00:11:49,967
give light from the top like this,

212
00:11:49,992 --> 00:11:51,906
and increase the shadows as much as you can.

213
00:11:58,637 --> 00:12:00,363
The more shadows there are,

214
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:05,810
the more information there should be,

215
00:12:07,188 --> 00:12:08,721
and with more information,

216
00:12:08,723 --> 00:12:12,725
the first impression will be stronger.

217
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:19,060
Let's compare.

218
00:12:19,085 --> 00:12:19,789
Before,

219
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:20,627
and after.

220
00:12:20,885 --> 00:12:22,310
You see the differences, right?

221
00:12:23,294 --> 00:12:26,724
At first glance, does the character make a strong impact?

222
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:29,467
Or does it merge into the background

223
00:12:29,492 --> 00:12:30,730
and take some time to be recognizable?

224
00:12:30,988 --> 00:12:33,309
Be aware of these differences.

225
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:38,004
So far, I told you how the amount of information changes

226
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:40,723
depending on the lighting.

227
00:12:41,115 --> 00:12:44,329
Now, let's learn more theories about lighting.

228
00:12:44,404 --> 00:12:46,694
We're going to use light

229
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,742
so we need to know what it's about.

230
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,954
First, I'll give the definition

231
00:12:50,271 --> 00:12:52,173
of what light

232
00:12:52,185 --> 00:12:54,221
actually is.

233
00:13:00,398 --> 00:13:01,115
Light.

234
00:13:01,894 --> 00:13:05,022
There is light when

235
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,172
we start perceiving an object.

236
00:13:07,174 --> 00:13:10,110
When we 'see' an object,

237
00:13:10,135 --> 00:13:12,196
we're not perceiving the object itself.

238
00:13:12,221 --> 00:13:13,810
We're perceiving it because

239
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:16,897
we see the light bouncing off the object.

240
00:13:17,115 --> 00:13:20,069
So, when we see an object,

241
00:13:20,094 --> 00:13:22,643
light is an essential element.

242
00:13:22,827 --> 00:13:25,953
I just mentioned that objects reflect light.

243
00:13:25,954 --> 00:13:27,618
Let's find out about this.

244
00:13:27,702 --> 00:13:31,063
Basically, an object reflects light differently

245
00:13:31,088 --> 00:13:32,815
based on its color.

246
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,331
For instance, let's say the sunlight is white.

247
00:13:37,571 --> 00:13:38,805
White light

248
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:41,123
contains all the colors of light.

249
00:13:41,773 --> 00:13:43,950
On the other hand, when there's no color,

250
00:13:43,975 --> 00:13:45,208
there would be black light.

251
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:49,382
So, all the colors are included in sunlight.

252
00:13:49,383 --> 00:13:50,563
What does that mean?

253
00:13:50,588 --> 00:13:52,658
Let's say a rainbow is formed here.

254
00:13:53,783 --> 00:13:54,683
The rainbow is here,

255
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:58,037
and let's say the character has

256
00:14:01,352 --> 00:14:02,731
a yellow object.

257
00:14:06,277 --> 00:14:07,721
If it's a yellow object,

258
00:14:07,775 --> 00:14:10,699
what kind of light would it reflect?

259
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,292
This object

260
00:14:12,317 --> 00:14:14,727
reflects yellow, just like its original color.

261
00:14:16,402 --> 00:14:19,781
Then, what happens to the other light colors?

262
00:14:19,782 --> 00:14:21,524
The object just absorbs it.

263
00:14:23,098 --> 00:14:25,477
What phenomenon happens because of this?

264
00:14:25,502 --> 00:14:28,021
You know when we have black shirts and white shirts,

265
00:14:28,046 --> 00:14:30,935
we would wear white shirts in summer?

266
00:14:31,544 --> 00:14:32,483
Why do we do that?

267
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:36,277
Remember how the color white contains all colors?

268
00:14:37,181 --> 00:14:38,110
That would mean

269
00:14:38,135 --> 00:14:41,817
white objects reflect all colors.

270
00:14:42,183 --> 00:14:45,742
Because it reflects more light, it absorbs less light

271
00:14:45,767 --> 00:14:48,722
and when we wear it, we will feel much cooler.

272
00:14:48,881 --> 00:14:53,119
On the other hand, black clothes absorb all light.

273
00:14:53,144 --> 00:14:56,242
That's why when we wear it, we will feel hot.

274
00:14:56,592 --> 00:14:58,394
So, with white clothes and black clothes,

275
00:14:58,419 --> 00:15:00,525
there's that kind of difference in heat.

276
00:15:01,725 --> 00:15:04,970
So, now you understood that an object reflects light.

277
00:15:04,995 --> 00:15:07,422
It reflects light that has the same color as itself.

278
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:10,385
So, how can you utilize this in illustrations?

279
00:15:10,819 --> 00:15:12,350
Here, you need to be aware of

280
00:15:13,717 --> 00:15:15,642
the background color.

281
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:24,356
When you're illustrating, you often need to

282
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,294
depict the background color well.

283
00:15:26,319 --> 00:15:29,210
So, let's find out what it is.

284
00:15:29,369 --> 00:15:32,438
The background color is the color of the background.

285
00:15:32,463 --> 00:15:33,794
You can think of it as the color

286
00:15:33,819 --> 00:15:36,306
of the air in the space.

287
00:15:37,415 --> 00:15:39,770
Let's say a character is in a red room.

288
00:15:40,154 --> 00:15:41,533
If it is in a red room,

289
00:15:41,558 --> 00:15:43,175
what would the overall atmosphere be like?

290
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:45,095
Well, the character would look red.

291
00:15:45,097 --> 00:15:48,121
Just like when we go to a butcher shop.

292
00:15:48,504 --> 00:15:50,479
But what happens if it's in a green room?

293
00:15:50,504 --> 00:15:52,140
Everything would look green.

294
00:15:52,474 --> 00:15:55,179
Then, we say the background color is green.

295
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:56,913
Then, let's see how

296
00:15:56,938 --> 00:15:59,021
the background color would be applied.

297
00:15:59,904 --> 00:16:01,866
Let's say there's an object.

298
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,452
I'll draw it as a circle.

299
00:16:04,477 --> 00:16:05,839
There's an object,

300
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:07,658
and it is yellow this time.

301
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:16,400
And right next to it, there's a blue object.

302
00:16:18,933 --> 00:16:20,335
I'll explain it more in detail,

303
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,406
but these two colors are complementary colors.

304
00:16:25,096 --> 00:16:27,281
Complementary colors are

305
00:16:27,306 --> 00:16:30,452
on the opposite sides on the color wheel.

306
00:16:30,677 --> 00:16:32,829
In other words, they are opposite colors.

307
00:16:33,004 --> 00:16:35,333
So, now that we have colored them,

308
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:39,015
we're going to give them lighting.

309
00:16:39,452 --> 00:16:41,059
I'm going to use the Overlay layer

310
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,498
to give them lighting.

311
00:16:42,863 --> 00:16:44,847
I'm now going to give them yellow lighting.

312
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:47,000
Remember how yellow objects are yellow

313
00:16:47,025 --> 00:16:49,116
since they reflect yellow light?

314
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,400
Then, would the saturation be strong or weak

315
00:16:52,425 --> 00:16:54,273
if we give it yellow lighting?

316
00:16:55,285 --> 00:16:56,706
When you give it yellow lighting,

317
00:16:56,872 --> 00:16:59,333
it will have a stronger saturation.

318
00:16:59,998 --> 00:17:02,044
If you see the Color Picker on the right,

319
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:03,906
you can see that it goes to the top right.

320
00:17:04,673 --> 00:17:07,244
Going to the right means the saturation is getting stronger.

321
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:08,819
Then, on the other hand,

322
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:12,142
when there's yellow light,

323
00:17:12,167 --> 00:17:14,413
let's think of what would happen if there's yellow light

324
00:17:14,438 --> 00:17:15,435
on a blue object.

325
00:17:15,794 --> 00:17:18,548
Blue objects reflect blue light.

326
00:17:18,573 --> 00:17:19,794
So, that would mean,

327
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:23,171
when there's yellow light, which is the complementary color,

328
00:17:23,173 --> 00:17:25,998
it means the object has no light to reflect.

329
00:17:26,373 --> 00:17:28,985
So, when you give it yellow lighting,

330
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,990
the saturation goes down.

331
00:17:32,273 --> 00:17:34,233
It's the opposite with yellow objects.

332
00:17:34,258 --> 00:17:36,425
So, this object has no light to reflect.

333
00:17:37,692 --> 00:17:39,848
This object can reflect blue light,

334
00:17:39,873 --> 00:17:41,648
so, when there's yellow light, which is a complementary color,

335
00:17:41,673 --> 00:17:42,867
it absorbs the yellow light.

336
00:17:43,277 --> 00:17:46,425
But, if there's blue light, the situation becomes the opposite.

337
00:17:46,783 --> 00:17:48,752
The blue object has a stronger saturation,

338
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:51,629
and the yellow one has a weaker saturation.

339
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:55,919
Depending on the type of lighting,

340
00:17:55,944 --> 00:17:58,179
the color of the object would change.

341
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:03,183
So, it's very important, and it's very complex.

342
00:18:03,377 --> 00:18:05,356
You need to remember this

343
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:08,498
because we are going to talk about optical illusions.

344
00:18:08,523 --> 00:18:10,738
That's why I emphasized background colors.

345
00:18:12,281 --> 00:18:13,217
Optical illusions.

346
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:18,452
Basically, human eyes have a deficiency.

347
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,715
Actually, the optic nerves should be placed outside of the eyes.

348
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,310
But, our optic nerves are inside the eyes.

349
00:18:26,194 --> 00:18:28,165
So, we have a lot of optic nerves.

350
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,194
And when light passes through them,

351
00:18:31,219 --> 00:18:33,804
we should be seeing our optic nerves.

352
00:18:34,104 --> 00:18:35,931
But, when we actually look at things,

353
00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:40,417
we can't see the numerous optic nerves.

354
00:18:40,792 --> 00:18:42,015
Why does that happen?

355
00:18:42,398 --> 00:18:44,913
People's eyes tend to vibrate.

356
00:18:46,113 --> 00:18:47,625
Our bodies vibrate,

357
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:50,615
and when our eyes vibrate, our optic nerves

358
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,531
also vibrate in the same frequency.

359
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,779
So, the brain

360
00:18:54,804 --> 00:18:57,602
automatically deletes the vibrating optic nerves.

361
00:18:58,027 --> 00:19:00,627
It perceives it as a part of our body because it vibrates together.

362
00:19:00,629 --> 00:19:02,002
So, it decides not to show them

363
00:19:02,027 --> 00:19:03,490
in order that we would only see the scenery around us.

364
00:19:03,515 --> 00:19:05,471
So, the optic nerves that vibrate with us

365
00:19:05,496 --> 00:19:07,146
are deleted from our minds.

366
00:19:07,704 --> 00:19:09,385
So, the brain uses a lot of energy.

367
00:19:09,938 --> 00:19:11,446
And in that process,

368
00:19:11,471 --> 00:19:13,496
optical illusions are created.

369
00:19:13,729 --> 00:19:16,535
Those were the basics, but it wasn't that much.

370
00:19:17,594 --> 00:19:20,294
Then, what should we know about optical illusions?

371
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:21,685
There's a lot we need to know.

372
00:19:25,769 --> 00:19:28,856
If there's a straight line and a curved line,

373
00:19:29,073 --> 00:19:31,219
while these two are actually the same length,

374
00:19:31,244 --> 00:19:32,865
the curved line looks a bit longer.

375
00:19:33,681 --> 00:19:36,287
Or, when there's a cut off line,

376
00:19:38,796 --> 00:19:40,718
instead of connecting them,

377
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,308
it looks more natural when one of them is lifted.

378
00:19:46,492 --> 00:19:48,355
Because the line goes downwards,

379
00:19:48,357 --> 00:19:51,226
it looks like it goes down more in this area.

380
00:19:51,777 --> 00:19:54,190
So, instead of connecting them,

381
00:19:54,215 --> 00:19:55,469
it looks more natural

382
00:19:55,481 --> 00:19:57,127
if one of them goes down a bit more.

383
00:19:57,152 --> 00:19:59,388
You'll use these optical illusions some day.

384
00:19:59,504 --> 00:20:01,019
But, the ones I mentioned are not related to color.

385
00:20:01,183 --> 00:20:03,525
Then, what kind of optical illusions do we use with colors?

386
00:20:05,275 --> 00:20:06,950
It's the contrast between warm and cool colors.

387
00:20:12,483 --> 00:20:14,213
This is also very important.

388
00:20:17,138 --> 00:20:18,037
The contrast between warm and cool colors.

389
00:20:18,088 --> 00:20:20,667
It's a phenomenon that happens when there's contrast

390
00:20:20,692 --> 00:20:24,343
between warm and cool colors.

391
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:26,888
Before that, let's talk about the mood of colors.

392
00:20:26,913 --> 00:20:30,690
When we say warm and cool colors,

393
00:20:30,715 --> 00:20:33,142
which colors are warm and which colors are cool?

394
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:35,923
Reddish colors will be the warm colors.

395
00:20:36,665 --> 00:20:39,512
Colors like red, orange and yellow are the warm colors.

396
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:43,006
On the other hand, the bluish colors will be the cool colors.

397
00:20:43,915 --> 00:20:45,312
So, when we use them,

398
00:20:45,324 --> 00:20:47,594
why is the contrast between them so important

399
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:49,050
that we have to remember it?

400
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,900
The first thing we need to know

401
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,892
is that when two colors are used together,

402
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,231
both of them are emphasized.

403
00:20:56,778 --> 00:20:58,975
When we use red and blue together,

404
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,219
because they are warm and cool colors,

405
00:21:01,244 --> 00:21:02,812
when we look at an image,

406
00:21:02,824 --> 00:21:04,975
they look a bit remote from each other.

407
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,822
That means both of them are emphasized.

408
00:21:08,073 --> 00:21:11,673
So, if you slip up with the color choice,

409
00:21:11,698 --> 00:21:14,385
the illustration could look out of style.

410
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:18,210
It could look childish and distracting.

411
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,286
And your eyes could hurt looking at it.

412
00:21:20,481 --> 00:21:21,902
But, of course,

413
00:21:21,927 --> 00:21:23,965
you can compose the illustration

414
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,713
so the viewer's eyes get sore on purpose.

415
00:21:25,963 --> 00:21:28,063
But, if you don't want that

416
00:21:28,088 --> 00:21:30,756
and if you want a calm illustration,

417
00:21:30,781 --> 00:21:33,133
then how would you use warm and cool colors.

418
00:21:34,991 --> 00:21:36,246
The first method is to

419
00:21:36,613 --> 00:21:38,792
increase the area for one color.

420
00:21:40,335 --> 00:21:42,183
If there are a lot of reds,

421
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:44,598
and if the blues are only placed in small areas,

422
00:21:45,656 --> 00:21:47,821
you can divide it into the main elements and the sub elements.

423
00:21:48,608 --> 00:21:50,640
Of course, it can be done the opposite way, too.

424
00:21:51,381 --> 00:21:53,600
If one color becomes the main color,

425
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,046
even if both colors are emphasized,

426
00:21:55,058 --> 00:21:56,538
we can arrange the colors effectively.

427
00:21:56,563 --> 00:21:57,944
The second method is to

428
00:21:57,969 --> 00:21:59,635
decrease the saturation of one of them.

429
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,071
I decreased the saturation of the blue part.

430
00:22:04,096 --> 00:22:06,342
So the red part is emphasized more.

431
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:08,631
You can put an emphasis on one of the colors

432
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,247
to give them some balance.

433
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:13,633
So, when do we use this method a lot?

434
00:22:13,692 --> 00:22:15,222
We use this with complementary colors.

435
00:22:15,322 --> 00:22:17,779
Remember how complementary colors are opposite colors?

436
00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:18,592
So, let's do this.

437
00:22:18,617 --> 00:22:21,629
Green is the complementary color of red.

438
00:22:21,654 --> 00:22:23,322
Look up the color wheel for this one.

439
00:22:23,598 --> 00:22:25,608
What happens if we use them together?

440
00:22:26,085 --> 00:22:27,442
It becomes out of style.

441
00:22:27,506 --> 00:22:29,673
It kind of looks like kimchi.

442
00:22:29,698 --> 00:22:33,179
So, when you're using complementary colors,

443
00:22:33,191 --> 00:22:35,648
if you just use this, it will look awkward.

444
00:22:35,673 --> 00:22:37,306
So how can we use this?

445
00:22:37,472 --> 00:22:39,441
We can set the red as the main color

446
00:22:40,496 --> 00:22:42,216
and set the green as the supplementary color.

447
00:22:42,241 --> 00:22:45,223
Or, you can decrease the saturation of the green,

448
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:50,179
and if you do that,

449
00:22:50,191 --> 00:22:52,400
the red and the green complement each other well.

450
00:22:52,674 --> 00:22:53,606
If you just think of

451
00:22:53,631 --> 00:22:56,035
the impressions of colors,

452
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,522
complementary colors

453
00:22:57,814 --> 00:22:59,591
harmonize with each other.

454
00:22:59,616 --> 00:23:01,541
But, when you're using them,

455
00:23:01,566 --> 00:23:04,268
if both of them have a strong saturation,

456
00:23:04,293 --> 00:23:07,243
your eyes would be sore and the illustration becomes too strong.

457
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,879
So, if you decrease the saturation of one of them,

458
00:23:10,904 --> 00:23:13,145
you can balance the overall image well.

459
00:23:13,379 --> 00:23:16,201
That's the method we use for cool and warm colors.

460
00:23:16,226 --> 00:23:18,608
This is used often, so remember it.

461
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,831
Now, let's look at another example.

462
00:23:23,714 --> 00:23:26,229
What we previously learned was that when we use

463
00:23:26,254 --> 00:23:28,018
complementary colors for the warm and cool colors,

464
00:23:28,093 --> 00:23:31,105
they emphasize each other.

465
00:23:31,239 --> 00:23:32,914
What we're going to learn now is

466
00:23:33,214 --> 00:23:37,053
when a single color fills up a screen,

467
00:23:39,295 --> 00:23:46,855
and when a color with low saturation is placed inside,

468
00:23:47,101 --> 00:23:50,265
it looks relatively bluish.

469
00:23:50,267 --> 00:23:53,342
Let's say that in a classroom, all the students are nice.

470
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,643
They're all nice kids,

471
00:23:54,668 --> 00:23:56,776
but one of them slipped up

472
00:23:56,801 --> 00:23:57,891
just once.

473
00:23:58,116 --> 00:24:00,889
But, because all the other kids are nice,

474
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,928
he or she would grab everyone's attention.

475
00:24:03,212 --> 00:24:04,318
It's the same logic.

476
00:24:04,343 --> 00:24:06,495
The background color is red.

477
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,681
And this color just has low saturation.

478
00:24:08,706 --> 00:24:11,099
So, to our eyes, it looks blue.

479
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,943
Let's look at another example.

480
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,391
I worked on this a long time ago.

481
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:23,429
When you look at the characters' skin color,

482
00:24:23,454 --> 00:24:26,618
you can see that they have realistic

483
00:24:26,643 --> 00:24:27,857
skin tones.

484
00:24:27,965 --> 00:24:30,016
But, what if we use the Color Picker?

485
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:34,041
You can see that not even orangeish colors were used.

486
00:24:34,166 --> 00:24:36,941
The colors are all bluish.

487
00:24:38,091 --> 00:24:42,283
But, because the skin colors have lower saturation

488
00:24:42,284 --> 00:24:43,870
compared to the blue background,

489
00:24:43,895 --> 00:24:46,864
the brain automatically perceives it as

490
00:24:46,889 --> 00:24:49,108
being a reddish color.

491
00:24:49,916 --> 00:24:51,649
Because of this optical illusion,

492
00:24:51,674 --> 00:24:54,138
a lot of people make mistakes with colors.

493
00:24:54,297 --> 00:24:55,833
When we have a background like this,

494
00:24:55,858 --> 00:24:59,556
even when we have a small reddish area with low saturation,

495
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:02,605
it looks like a beige color.

496
00:25:02,872 --> 00:25:04,487
It looks like a yellowish color.

497
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,728
The color I picked with the Color Picker is purple.

498
00:25:06,795 --> 00:25:09,515
But, it will look yellowish, not purpleish.

499
00:25:09,712 --> 00:25:12,572
The difference between knowing and not knowing

500
00:25:12,597 --> 00:25:14,170
these optical illusions

501
00:25:14,195 --> 00:25:16,522
will be huge when you color your works.

502
00:25:17,306 --> 00:25:19,956
So, you need to know about them.

503
00:25:20,497 --> 00:25:22,383
So, we've looked at warm and cool colors.

504
00:25:22,408 --> 00:25:24,349
The two important things we should know are

505
00:25:24,458 --> 00:25:26,441
first, when two colors are both emphasized,

506
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,912
and two, when one color predominates,

507
00:25:28,937 --> 00:25:31,722
even a small low-saturated color draws attention

508
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:33,622
and looks like a complementary color.

509
00:25:33,814 --> 00:25:35,859
So, let's utilize this

510
00:25:35,871 --> 00:25:37,849
to give lighting to the character.

511
00:25:52,977 --> 00:25:54,637
Let's create a scenario.

512
00:25:56,696 --> 00:25:59,431
Let's say the sun is setting.

513
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,204
So, overall, there would be a lot of orange.

514
00:26:03,206 --> 00:26:05,499
Because the character's skin is generally yellowish,

515
00:26:05,501 --> 00:26:08,435
the color of its skin will have higher saturation.

516
00:26:10,699 --> 00:26:12,037
It will have higher saturation,

517
00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:14,623
and the overall color will be yellowish.

518
00:26:16,697 --> 00:26:19,512
If you think about whether the light is strong or weak,

519
00:26:19,546 --> 00:26:21,056
the sunset light will be weak.

520
00:26:21,198 --> 00:26:24,931
Because it's weak, the contrast will be smaller.

521
00:26:26,231 --> 00:26:28,119
Stronger light means bigger contrast

522
00:26:28,144 --> 00:26:30,644
and weaker light means smaller contrast.

523
00:26:32,369 --> 00:26:35,175
So, there's less difference between the light and the shadows.

524
00:26:35,241 --> 00:26:37,919
Let's say the character has a blue crystal ball.

525
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:42,598
It has a blue crystal ball.

526
00:26:45,598 --> 00:26:47,310
Let me make it more natural.

527
00:26:47,335 --> 00:26:49,304
It's holding a blue crystal ball like this.

528
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,979
Then, what would happen if it gets yellow light?

529
00:26:53,683 --> 00:26:56,094
How should we compose it

530
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:57,860
so that it harmonizes with the background?

531
00:27:02,196 --> 00:27:04,799
Let's apply the sunset to the background.

532
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,590
The answer would be decreasing the saturation

533
00:27:07,857 --> 00:27:10,244
and increasing the reds.

534
00:27:11,369 --> 00:27:13,682
What color do we get with blue and red?

535
00:27:13,684 --> 00:27:15,067
We'll have purple.

536
00:27:16,775 --> 00:27:17,915
I'll control this slider.

537
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:21,704
So, the color

538
00:27:21,904 --> 00:27:23,775
will look like this.

539
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,373
This ball used to be blue.

540
00:27:25,398 --> 00:27:28,704
But, because of the orange light, it is now a low saturated purple color.

541
00:27:29,087 --> 00:27:30,594
You can understand it like that.

542
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:33,115
So, this is how you moderate colors

543
00:27:33,344 --> 00:27:37,048
based on the coloring method you used.

544
00:27:37,206 --> 00:27:39,245
Now, we're going to give blue lighting.

545
00:27:39,387 --> 00:27:41,835
What would happen if we give it blue light?

546
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,269
Then, the ball would have a higher saturation.

547
00:27:45,512 --> 00:27:46,900
It will have a higher saturation,

548
00:27:47,575 --> 00:27:49,350
and it will be more bluish.

549
00:27:50,983 --> 00:27:52,498
Same with the character.

550
00:27:52,765 --> 00:27:54,302
We're going to give it blue lighting.

551
00:27:54,303 --> 00:27:56,521
But, it will be the opposite for the character.

552
00:27:56,788 --> 00:27:58,637
Its saturation will decrease a lot

553
00:27:59,613 --> 00:28:01,500
since its skin color is a reddish color.

554
00:28:01,796 --> 00:28:03,433
The saturation would decrease,

555
00:28:03,683 --> 00:28:05,767
and its skin color would have more bluish colors.

556
00:28:05,792 --> 00:28:07,975
That's how the lighting will be applied.

557
00:28:08,492 --> 00:28:10,817
A character that is lit at night

558
00:28:10,842 --> 00:28:12,992
would be in this kind of background.

559
00:28:13,387 --> 00:28:15,479
So, when you're coloring the background,

560
00:28:15,504 --> 00:28:17,815
the contrast between warm and cool colors

561
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,006
has a huge impact.

562
00:28:19,181 --> 00:28:22,187
Knowing these things and applying them

563
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,077
was what I explained today.

564
00:28:25,902 --> 00:28:28,127
So, now we learned how to

565
00:28:28,152 --> 00:28:30,490
control the amount of information with lighting.

566
00:28:31,181 --> 00:28:33,583
We learned how give more or less information with lighting.

567
00:28:33,608 --> 00:28:36,062
We also learned the basics of

568
00:28:36,087 --> 00:28:38,875
how to use warm and cool colors to

569
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,573
color in the background

570
00:28:41,598 --> 00:28:43,396
and how those colors would change.

571
00:28:44,577 --> 00:28:45,774
Now, all that's left is the actual drawing.

572
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:48,544
Let's apply what we've learned to an example.

573
00:29:00,477 --> 00:29:02,217
Now, I'm going to draw a night background

574
00:29:02,242 --> 00:29:04,647
behind the character.

575
00:29:07,406 --> 00:29:11,106
Because it's night, there will be dark blue lighting.

576
00:29:18,498 --> 00:29:21,027
And the character would be in that background.

577
00:29:21,127 --> 00:29:23,921
Now, when we think of lighting,

578
00:29:23,923 --> 00:29:26,110
there's something we need to decide.

579
00:29:28,602 --> 00:29:30,880
When we set the lighting, there are

580
00:29:30,892 --> 00:29:32,658
four things we need to think about.

581
00:29:34,367 --> 00:29:35,866
The first thing is the number of light sources.

582
00:29:35,992 --> 00:29:38,654
With an illustration, there could be

583
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:40,296
more than one light source.

584
00:29:40,321 --> 00:29:42,323
So, we need to decide on its number.

585
00:29:44,594 --> 00:29:48,252
The second would be its direction, which is also important.

586
00:29:48,277 --> 00:29:49,427
We need to set its direction.

587
00:29:50,685 --> 00:29:53,648
Third, there's the intensity of the light.

588
00:29:53,673 --> 00:29:54,702
How strong should the light be?

589
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:55,923
Fourth, the color.

590
00:29:55,948 --> 00:29:57,202
What color is the light?

591
00:29:57,402 --> 00:29:58,775
So, these four aspects

592
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,223
are very important with lighting.

593
00:30:00,248 --> 00:30:01,998
So, when you're drawing,

594
00:30:02,023 --> 00:30:04,425
I recommend you make this chart and continue.

595
00:30:04,975 --> 00:30:06,912
So, now we're going to draw a night background.

596
00:30:06,914 --> 00:30:09,439
Let's see what kind of lighting we will apply.

597
00:30:13,983 --> 00:30:16,637
I'm going to go in more detail

598
00:30:16,721 --> 00:30:18,765
when we get into detailed coloring.

599
00:30:19,683 --> 00:30:21,302
The lighting I'll give now

600
00:30:21,896 --> 00:30:28,213
is a weak blue light coming from the front.

601
00:30:29,915 --> 00:30:33,604
And from the left behind

602
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:36,604
I'm going to give

603
00:30:37,179 --> 00:30:40,048
a bluish white light

604
00:30:41,106 --> 00:30:44,492
that is strong but with low saturation.

605
00:30:44,517 --> 00:30:46,435
So, let's apply these.

606
00:30:46,577 --> 00:30:49,258
Let's look at the frontal lighting first.

607
00:30:49,283 --> 00:30:51,643
The frontal light is weak.

608
00:30:51,702 --> 00:30:53,856
What happens with the contrast if the light is weak?

609
00:30:54,656 --> 00:30:58,325
If it's weak, the contrast decreases.

610
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,523
So, the overall contrast of the character would decrease.

611
00:31:12,875 --> 00:31:15,657
I'll minimize the difference between the bright and dark areas.

612
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:27,396
I'll minimize the contrast like this,

613
00:31:27,421 --> 00:31:29,738
and the overall color will be

614
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:31,888
a strong bluish color.

615
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:39,931
Because the light is weak, it will spread out more.

616
00:31:40,207 --> 00:31:42,315
This is called soft light.

617
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,552
But, I'll go into more detail later on.

618
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:55,340
So, that's it for the frontal light

619
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,573
which spreads out thinly.

620
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:00,011
Now that we're done with that,

621
00:32:00,036 --> 00:32:01,317
let's apply the Backlight.

622
00:32:01,492 --> 00:32:03,635
We decided to give it light from behind to the left.

623
00:32:03,911 --> 00:32:05,457
So, I'll make a new layer

624
00:32:21,367 --> 00:32:22,306
just like this.

625
00:32:39,015 --> 00:32:41,656
When we give this kind of lighting,

626
00:32:41,681 --> 00:32:43,097
we must understand

627
00:32:43,109 --> 00:32:45,043
the three-dimensional information of the character.

628
00:32:45,194 --> 00:32:48,904
So, when you're coloring a three-dimensional object,

629
00:32:48,929 --> 00:32:52,276
and if you don't know which planes should be brighter in what way,

630
00:32:52,604 --> 00:32:56,268
you shouldn't practice coloring

631
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:58,029
but practice drawing instead.

632
00:32:59,815 --> 00:33:03,091
When you have a better understanding of where an object is headed,

633
00:33:03,092 --> 00:33:05,249
your coloring will be more

634
00:33:05,704 --> 00:33:07,419
accurate and precise.

635
00:33:08,075 --> 00:33:10,840
So, to do that,

636
00:33:10,865 --> 00:33:12,902
you need to study forms.

637
00:33:12,927 --> 00:33:15,896
It's best if you study forms when you draw.

638
00:33:21,094 --> 00:33:24,810
So, this way, a character that gets light from the back at night

639
00:33:24,835 --> 00:33:26,041
is complete.

640
00:33:26,043 --> 00:33:28,358
If you draw a simple background,

641
00:33:35,344 --> 00:33:36,927
it will be this kind of drawing.

642
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:40,350
You might have seen this lighting style previously.

643
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,933
So, let's compose other situations too.

644
00:33:43,956 --> 00:33:47,066
Now, I'm going to

645
00:33:54,353 --> 00:33:58,562
color a character brightly, and also give it a bright background.

646
00:33:58,883 --> 00:34:00,797
So, when I apply that, how should I do it?

647
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,892
I told you that this character's clothing is simple.

648
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:08,245
Because it is simple, when you apply shadows,

649
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:14,064
it's better to increase the dark areas.

650
00:34:19,506 --> 00:34:22,370
Now, we're going to give it some variables.

651
00:34:25,992 --> 00:34:27,784
This would be my thought

652
00:34:27,796 --> 00:34:29,933
when I want to dress it up.

653
00:34:30,598 --> 00:34:32,567
When I give it detailed clothes,

654
00:34:32,592 --> 00:34:36,025
the lighting will become quite different.

655
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:39,213
Because the design itself is information.

656
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:44,319
So, if we utilize this example with clothes,

657
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,958
and if we apply shadows just like we did before,

658
00:35:10,298 --> 00:35:11,731
you can see that

659
00:35:20,002 --> 00:35:23,422
the illustration becomes quite complicated.

660
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,467
Previously, when there was just skin,

661
00:35:25,492 --> 00:35:26,983
and when lighting was applied,

662
00:35:27,008 --> 00:35:29,844
the character would just have a strong impression.

663
00:35:29,869 --> 00:35:31,652
But, because it has sophisticated clothing,

664
00:35:31,677 --> 00:35:34,040
the illustration would look very dark

665
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:36,264
and complicated.

666
00:35:36,465 --> 00:35:38,085
It would have a much stronger impression.

667
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,438
So, when you want to

668
00:35:39,463 --> 00:35:41,762
draw sophisticated outfits

669
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:43,856
to increase the amount of information,

670
00:35:43,881 --> 00:35:46,938
you should apply less lighting

671
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,221
and decrease the dark areas.

672
00:35:59,425 --> 00:36:02,860
That way, the drawing would be much more neat.

673
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:15,408
If you do this,

674
00:36:15,441 --> 00:36:18,595
it would have a much more neat impression.

675
00:36:18,906 --> 00:36:20,488
There's another method.

676
00:36:20,513 --> 00:36:22,902
I mentioned decreasing the dark areas.

677
00:36:22,927 --> 00:36:24,317
But, to be precise,

678
00:36:24,342 --> 00:36:27,540
it's all about whether the dimension of

679
00:36:27,565 --> 00:36:29,650
the light and dark areas are equal.

680
00:36:30,298 --> 00:36:33,423
So, previously,

681
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:35,379
I applied a lot of lighting to it.

682
00:36:35,404 --> 00:36:39,181
The second method would be

683
00:36:39,193 --> 00:36:40,813
applying a lot of dark areas.

684
00:36:43,604 --> 00:36:47,018
Let's give it a weak amount of darkness.

685
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:50,477
We'll give it just a little bit of light.

686
00:37:26,883 --> 00:37:28,917
We're not giving light to a large area,

687
00:37:28,995 --> 00:37:32,108
but we're giving light only to a small area,

688
00:37:34,796 --> 00:37:36,171
like this.

689
00:37:36,196 --> 00:37:38,560
So, in this way,

690
00:37:38,572 --> 00:37:40,679
we only slightly colored the illustration.

691
00:37:45,604 --> 00:37:47,506
So, these two methods,

692
00:37:48,194 --> 00:37:50,711
in other words, by either increasing the light or the darkness

693
00:37:50,736 --> 00:37:52,799
to cover up the surface,

694
00:37:53,078 --> 00:37:56,405
they are commonly used when the design is sophisticated.

695
00:37:56,699 --> 00:37:59,815
This would be utilizing the amount of information.

696
00:38:00,002 --> 00:38:04,923
This is how we would describe

697
00:38:05,498 --> 00:38:06,803
a character in daylight.

698
00:38:07,293 --> 00:38:10,199
We also experimented with the night lights.

699
00:38:10,581 --> 00:38:11,980
And also daylight.

700
00:38:12,005 --> 00:38:14,307
So, we looked at two scenarios.

701
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:19,525
If you've learned this much,

702
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:21,489
you can keep changing the settings

703
00:38:21,514 --> 00:38:23,898
to apply lighting to the illustration.

704
00:38:24,318 --> 00:38:25,919
Let's go to the beginning.

705
00:38:29,085 --> 00:38:30,504
Let's set the table

706
00:38:30,529 --> 00:38:32,397
when we're looking at these pictures.

707
00:38:35,205 --> 00:38:37,902
With this example, the light is coming from the top left.

708
00:38:38,782 --> 00:38:42,616
And the light will be a reddish light.

709
00:38:44,316 --> 00:38:46,099
It's a reddish light,

710
00:38:46,124 --> 00:38:49,390
and you can see that the top left is bright.

711
00:38:50,063 --> 00:38:52,722
You might ask if this character's shadow has no light at all.

712
00:38:52,724 --> 00:38:54,026
But, that's not true.

713
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:56,021
I'll explain it further later on, but,

714
00:38:56,401 --> 00:38:59,180
the fact that we can see this object

715
00:38:59,205 --> 00:39:00,990
even without light,

716
00:39:01,015 --> 00:39:02,908
means that light is coming from somewhere.

717
00:39:03,768 --> 00:39:06,212
The light that would be applied is the background color.

718
00:39:09,073 --> 00:39:10,511
We can predict the background color

719
00:39:10,536 --> 00:39:13,225
when we look at the character's shadows.

720
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:17,261
So, we can know that this character's background color

721
00:39:17,286 --> 00:39:18,458
is a reddish color.

722
00:39:18,512 --> 00:39:20,509
So, in this example,

723
00:39:20,534 --> 00:39:22,304
there are two main kinds of light.

724
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:23,975
The light coming from the top left,

725
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,186
and the background color that comes to the shadows.

726
00:39:28,127 --> 00:39:30,799
Actually, the background color is all around the character,

727
00:39:30,824 --> 00:39:32,700
so it's hard to set its direction.

728
00:39:33,619 --> 00:39:37,799
Just think of it as coming from the front.

729
00:39:37,995 --> 00:39:40,854
Because, our eyes perceive

730
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:44,327
extruding objects as being brighter.

731
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,083
When there is reflecting light,

732
00:39:47,108 --> 00:39:50,026
and a reflecting light that comes from afar,

733
00:39:50,028 --> 00:39:51,943
this light would be more strongly reflected.

734
00:39:52,592 --> 00:39:55,927
Then, the light looks strong from the foreground.

735
00:39:56,308 --> 00:39:57,589
So, when you're looking at an object,

736
00:39:57,614 --> 00:40:00,105
the highlight is usually placed at the front.

737
00:40:01,471 --> 00:40:03,261
So, to think of it simply,

738
00:40:03,286 --> 00:40:05,200
the background color comes from all directions,

739
00:40:05,225 --> 00:40:08,342
but is stronger from the front.

740
00:40:10,384 --> 00:40:11,932
Let's fill in this chart.

741
00:40:11,957 --> 00:40:14,307
We have two lights.

742
00:40:15,422 --> 00:40:17,242
The direction would be the top left

743
00:40:19,188 --> 00:40:20,819
and the front.

744
00:40:23,736 --> 00:40:26,146
The color - this would be a red color

745
00:40:27,676 --> 00:40:28,505
that has low saturation.

746
00:40:28,905 --> 00:40:31,433
If it's highly saturated, the skin would be really red.

747
00:40:32,595 --> 00:40:37,200
The dark areas have highly saturated red colors.

748
00:40:40,006 --> 00:40:42,930
The intensity of the light - this light is strong,

749
00:40:44,314 --> 00:40:46,857
and the background color is weak.

750
00:40:47,484 --> 00:40:48,912
Those would be the characteristics.

751
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:51,022
The same would be applied here.

752
00:40:51,047 --> 00:40:52,373
If you apply those things,

753
00:40:52,398 --> 00:40:53,435
because the character

754
00:40:53,437 --> 00:40:55,123
is in a blue background,

755
00:40:55,148 --> 00:40:57,212
you can see that its skin has low saturation.

756
00:40:57,385 --> 00:41:00,057
Also, there's additional lighting from underneath.

757
00:41:00,795 --> 00:41:03,181
If we have different lightings like this,

758
00:41:03,206 --> 00:41:05,238
we can make a chart like this,

759
00:41:05,263 --> 00:41:07,668
and we can approach it more easily.

760
00:41:07,693 --> 00:41:10,332
Most of all, it will help you a lot

761
00:41:10,357 --> 00:41:11,758
when you draw the exact image

762
00:41:11,783 --> 00:41:13,536
that you thought of.

763
00:41:13,716 --> 00:41:15,180
I emphasize to my students

764
00:41:15,205 --> 00:41:17,899
to draw this chart.

765
00:41:17,924 --> 00:41:20,098
So, when you're creating an illustration,

766
00:41:20,123 --> 00:41:22,098
and if you're coloring,

767
00:41:22,291 --> 00:41:23,439
before you do that,

768
00:41:23,464 --> 00:41:26,601
I recommend you to draw a chart.

769
00:41:26,708 --> 00:41:27,767
We're doing this because

770
00:41:27,792 --> 00:41:29,198
if we don't do this,

771
00:41:29,223 --> 00:41:32,803
say you want to give the character a different lighting

772
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:34,397
to what you've previously done.

773
00:41:34,399 --> 00:41:35,771
But, as you work on it,

774
00:41:35,796 --> 00:41:38,484
the lighting will be similar

775
00:41:38,509 --> 00:41:39,742
to what you've previously done.

776
00:41:40,002 --> 00:41:43,012
So, to prevent that, you have to draw a chart.

777
00:41:44,392 --> 00:41:46,620
I'll give you some more examples.

778
00:41:50,114 --> 00:41:52,015
What kind of lighting should I apply now?

779
00:41:52,089 --> 00:41:55,899
Suppose we're placing this character in a green room.

780
00:42:00,555 --> 00:42:02,285
The background will be green.

781
00:42:03,086 --> 00:42:04,339
I'll create a new Layer.

782
00:42:22,218 --> 00:42:24,726
Because the background will be green,

783
00:42:24,751 --> 00:42:27,153
the overall color will be more greenish,

784
00:42:27,178 --> 00:42:29,999
and because its skin color is yellowish, or reddish,

785
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,596
the skin color would be less saturated

786
00:42:35,205 --> 00:42:36,643
and blend into the green background.

787
00:42:41,584 --> 00:42:44,320
So, now I'm going to give it lighting,

788
00:42:44,345 --> 00:42:46,233
but say that you want to give it soft lighting.

789
00:42:47,007 --> 00:42:48,384
So, now we'll learn about

790
00:42:48,409 --> 00:42:50,110
Soft Light and Hard Light.

791
00:43:05,663 --> 00:43:07,758
This isn't something that's too difficult.

792
00:43:07,783 --> 00:43:09,217
Literally, Soft Light is

793
00:43:09,242 --> 00:43:12,095
a light that softly spreads out,

794
00:43:12,188 --> 00:43:13,833
and Hard Light is

795
00:43:13,858 --> 00:43:16,346
a light with vivid shadows.

796
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:17,739
So, the Hard Light will be a stronger light,

797
00:43:17,764 --> 00:43:19,419
and the Soft Light will be a weaker light.

798
00:43:19,793 --> 00:43:22,093
So, how would they look?

799
00:43:22,118 --> 00:43:24,602
Previously, I mentioned 'the amount of information'.

800
00:43:25,902 --> 00:43:28,161
Out of these two, the one with

801
00:43:28,163 --> 00:43:29,735
generally more information

802
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,111
is the Soft Light.

803
00:43:31,298 --> 00:43:32,533
To put it simply,

804
00:43:32,558 --> 00:43:33,617
with Soft Light,

805
00:43:33,684 --> 00:43:36,311
the light layers are divided up between

806
00:43:36,336 --> 00:43:38,129
the light area and the shadow area.

807
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,803
Hard Light just creates two light layers.

808
00:43:42,943 --> 00:43:43,951
So,

809
00:43:43,976 --> 00:43:45,264
because of the amount of color,

810
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:48,028
Soft Light looks more complicated

811
00:43:49,495 --> 00:43:51,134
and creates better focus.

812
00:43:51,501 --> 00:43:53,546
So, now I drew

813
00:43:53,571 --> 00:43:55,713
the character's clothes simply.

814
00:43:55,715 --> 00:43:58,991
If you want to make it heavy

815
00:43:59,016 --> 00:44:00,593
while still maintaining the simple design,

816
00:44:00,618 --> 00:44:03,139
so that the gaze

817
00:44:03,164 --> 00:44:04,521
would focus on the character,

818
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:07,323
it would be better to use Soft Light.

819
00:44:07,543 --> 00:44:09,131
So, let's use it.

820
00:44:18,623 --> 00:44:21,533
I'm going to make the light come from the front.

821
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:04,049
To make it look soft,

822
00:45:04,074 --> 00:45:06,433
I recommend that you paint with Airbrush brushes.

823
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:23,909
The dark areas

824
00:45:23,934 --> 00:45:26,502
wouldn't be suddenly dark, but they would gradually get darker.

825
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:36,329
Let's keep putting in more information.

826
00:45:41,901 --> 00:45:45,050
It's different from the method I used when

827
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,812
I explained the amount of information.

828
00:45:46,866 --> 00:45:49,663
Previously, we increased the amount of shadows

829
00:45:49,688 --> 00:45:52,170
to increase the amount of information.

830
00:45:52,195 --> 00:45:54,488
Now, we're not increasing the amount of shadows,

831
00:45:54,513 --> 00:45:58,594
but we're increasing the layers between the light and the shadows.

832
00:46:01,486 --> 00:46:03,765
You can control the amount of information like this.

833
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:16,122
The more the light spreads out,

834
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:23,511
the more it sticks out.

835
00:46:26,979 --> 00:46:28,980
Let's look at the difference

836
00:46:29,005 --> 00:46:31,302
when we just apply lighting to the skin.

837
00:46:31,415 --> 00:46:32,106
Before.

838
00:46:33,699 --> 00:46:34,450
And after.

839
00:46:36,814 --> 00:46:39,768
You can see that our gaze goes towards

840
00:46:39,793 --> 00:46:41,519
the area in the middle.

841
00:46:48,602 --> 00:46:50,643
So, we can give characters lighting

842
00:46:50,668 --> 00:46:52,339
by using Soft Light.

843
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:10,911
With a simple character,

844
00:47:12,491 --> 00:47:15,349
or a character with a lot of skin exposure,

845
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:18,344
when you want to make it sexy,

846
00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:20,723
you'll use Soft Light a lot.

847
00:47:25,111 --> 00:47:26,591
So, let's summarize.

848
00:47:27,504 --> 00:47:30,465
We learned lighting today.

849
00:47:31,012 --> 00:47:33,484
When we apply lighting,

850
00:47:33,509 --> 00:47:38,094
we need to know

851
00:47:48,288 --> 00:47:49,718
three types of information.

852
00:47:50,185 --> 00:47:52,406
First, the amount of information.

853
00:47:55,405 --> 00:47:58,202
This information doesn't just apply to the coloring stage,

854
00:47:58,227 --> 00:48:00,588
but applies to the drawing stage as well.

855
00:48:00,613 --> 00:48:04,358
With what we've learned so far,

856
00:48:04,383 --> 00:48:05,782
when you're coloring,

857
00:48:05,902 --> 00:48:08,481
you need to set how much information you'd put in

858
00:48:08,506 --> 00:48:11,527
when you apply lighting.

859
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,415
That's what today's lecture was about.

860
00:48:13,695 --> 00:48:17,294
There are four ways to increase the amount of information.

861
00:48:18,188 --> 00:48:25,130
Saturation, density, contrast, and hues.

862
00:48:26,994 --> 00:48:28,148
You should be able to

863
00:48:28,173 --> 00:48:30,674
use these elements to control

864
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:32,315
the amount of information in coloring.

865
00:48:32,872 --> 00:48:34,435
The second thing I told you about

866
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:35,998
is the setting

867
00:48:36,051 --> 00:48:37,666
of your lighting.

868
00:48:41,516 --> 00:48:45,110
You should decide its angle and colors.

869
00:48:45,977 --> 00:48:47,610
There are four things you need to think about.

870
00:48:48,483 --> 00:48:56,410
The number, the color, the intensity, and the direction.

871
00:48:58,691 --> 00:49:00,299
Set these four elements

872
00:49:00,324 --> 00:49:02,423
so that you have the lighting

873
00:49:02,448 --> 00:49:04,028
that suits your image.

874
00:49:04,594 --> 00:49:06,733
Draw a table, and then continue.

875
00:49:07,091 --> 00:49:09,124
We also learned the contrast between warm and cool colors.

876
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:14,888
In other words, the optical illusion.

877
00:49:17,603 --> 00:49:20,103
The contrast can be divided into two scenarios.

878
00:49:20,416 --> 00:49:23,148
The first scenario is when you emphasize both the colors.

879
00:49:23,588 --> 00:49:25,587
The second scenario is when

880
00:49:25,612 --> 00:49:27,675
only one color becomes the main color

881
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:29,726
because one of the colors

882
00:49:30,382 --> 00:49:32,565
has a low saturation.

883
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:35,535
So, this would also be a type of emphasis.

884
00:49:35,696 --> 00:49:36,722
When you do that,

885
00:49:36,776 --> 00:49:40,319
I told you the usage for two different types.

886
00:49:41,165 --> 00:49:43,114
Now, the important thing is,

887
00:49:43,696 --> 00:49:45,946
if we have a yellow object,

888
00:49:45,971 --> 00:49:48,630
because it reflects yellow light,

889
00:49:48,632 --> 00:49:50,222
our eyes would perceive it as yellow.

890
00:49:50,583 --> 00:49:53,545
So, if the object has blue lighting applied,

891
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:56,092
the saturation would decrease.

892
00:49:56,588 --> 00:49:58,426
You should move on

893
00:49:58,451 --> 00:50:00,695
after you keep that in mind.

894
00:50:02,828 --> 00:50:05,234
What I told you on top of that

895
00:50:07,984 --> 00:50:09,570
is what's really important.

896
00:50:09,595 --> 00:50:12,547
I've additionally taught you Soft Light,

897
00:50:15,381 --> 00:50:16,290
and Hard Light.

898
00:50:19,376 --> 00:50:21,311
I told you these.

899
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:26,340
And, if I have to choose something

900
00:50:26,365 --> 00:50:28,988
that I really want to emphasize

901
00:50:29,013 --> 00:50:30,368
out of everything I told you here,

902
00:50:30,393 --> 00:50:32,512
I want to emphasize the amount of information.

903
00:50:32,792 --> 00:50:35,606
I didn't see a lot of people who thought of this in advance

904
00:50:35,631 --> 00:50:37,219
before they actually started drawing.

905
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:40,019
So, with the amount of information,

906
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:43,427
when we compare drawing to cooking,

907
00:50:43,793 --> 00:50:46,703
the recipe would be how we would compose the canvas.

908
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:48,503
What's most important?

909
00:50:48,505 --> 00:50:49,809
It's the seasoning.

910
00:50:50,003 --> 00:50:52,828
You have to determine whether it's

911
00:50:53,168 --> 00:50:54,101
salty, tasty,

912
00:50:54,126 --> 00:50:55,589
or just right.

913
00:50:55,614 --> 00:50:57,499
So, this concept is

914
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,588
something very essential.

915
00:50:59,613 --> 00:51:00,701
But there aren't many people

916
00:51:00,726 --> 00:51:03,121
who are conscious of it when coloring.

917
00:51:03,281 --> 00:51:06,795
So, if your character's design

918
00:51:12,796 --> 00:51:14,713
is simple,

919
00:51:18,371 --> 00:51:20,805
increase the lit parts and the shadowy parts

920
00:51:20,969 --> 00:51:22,433
to increase the amount of information.

921
00:51:22,706 --> 00:51:24,221
On the other hand,

922
00:51:24,501 --> 00:51:26,125
if it looks too complicated,

923
00:51:26,285 --> 00:51:29,015
make them focus on one side.

924
00:51:29,195 --> 00:51:30,617
Then, either increase the amount

925
00:51:31,604 --> 00:51:32,832
or decrease it.

926
00:51:32,912 --> 00:51:34,389
Do one of them,

927
00:51:34,414 --> 00:51:36,870
so that the character looks more clean.

928
00:51:37,315 --> 00:51:38,999
That would be putting in less seasoning.

929
00:51:39,085 --> 00:51:41,793
So, deciding whether you should add more or less information

930
00:51:41,818 --> 00:51:43,271
when you're coloring

931
00:51:43,296 --> 00:51:45,506
is the most important thing.

932
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,583
What we did today was an overall explanation of theories.

933
00:51:48,608 --> 00:51:50,384
Now, we're going to use them

934
00:51:50,409 --> 00:51:51,977
to actually draw.

935
00:51:52,002 --> 00:51:53,723
From now on, we're going to start with

936
00:51:53,857 --> 00:51:55,171
an illustration with a background.

937
00:51:55,196 --> 00:51:58,286
In other words, a full illustration.

938
00:51:58,311 --> 00:51:59,988
As you're doing it,

939
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:01,361
we're going to compose a thumbnail,

940
00:52:01,386 --> 00:52:03,632
and apply the base colors.

941
00:52:03,885 --> 00:52:05,764
While we're doing that,

942
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,248
we're going to use what we've learned,

943
00:52:07,273 --> 00:52:08,781
and change the lighting

944
00:52:08,806 --> 00:52:10,796
to change the overall mood.

945
00:52:11,287 --> 00:52:14,060
So, let's utilize what we've learned so far.

946
00:52:14,106 --> 00:52:16,085
This is the end of

947
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:17,376
today's lecture.

948
00:52:17,589 --> 00:52:18,821
Keep up the great work.
