00:00:06,494 --> 00:00:10,114
Hello, now is the time to start designing.

3
00:00:10,116 --> 00:00:12,799
From this lecture,

4
00:00:12,801 --> 00:00:16,167
students will have time to work on an actual drawing.

5
00:00:16,334 --> 00:00:20,371
We're going to design using what we've practiced before.

6
00:00:20,396 --> 00:00:22,136
Based on what we are going to design today,

7
00:00:22,161 --> 00:00:24,471
we're going to draw an illustration later.

8
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,471
If you're copying my examples as you're taking this lecture,

9
00:00:26,496 --> 00:00:27,860
I think

10
00:00:27,872 --> 00:00:30,369
you can follow the tempo I'm drawing at.

11
00:00:30,394 --> 00:00:33,717
The main course of our class starts today.

12
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:37,986
If possible, try drawing along during the class.

13
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:41,562
I think it'd be good if you draw with me.

14
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,409
Before we go in, let's wrap this up.

15
00:00:48,078 --> 00:00:49,034
Design.

16
00:00:50,889 --> 00:00:54,690
Some get scared of the word itself.

17
00:00:55,623 --> 00:00:57,152
Because they assume it's going to be too hard,

18
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,359
and it's not for us but for professionals.

19
00:01:00,384 --> 00:01:02,775
Some people think like that.

20
00:01:03,365 --> 00:01:06,284
Let's talk about what design is.

21
00:01:07,775 --> 00:01:10,680
Does a design have to be complicated?

22
00:01:20,542 --> 00:01:23,471
Should it be complicated?

23
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,504
What's important?

24
00:01:33,181 --> 00:01:35,541
How should we practice?

25
00:01:39,806 --> 00:01:42,900
We're going to talk about these things.

26
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,700
First of all, I'm going to show you the designs that I drew while scribbling.

27
00:01:48,725 --> 00:01:50,979
Let's open a few up and talk about them.

28
00:01:51,885 --> 00:01:54,075
When I am designing,

29
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,942
I emphasize the importance of the concept.

30
00:01:57,288 --> 00:01:59,128
You can say it's the first impression.

31
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:03,550
What kind of impression do you have when you first see your character?

32
00:02:03,575 --> 00:02:06,019
And if ten people look at it,

33
00:02:06,044 --> 00:02:08,120
would those ten people say the same things about it?

34
00:02:08,204 --> 00:02:10,119
I think it's very important.

35
00:02:11,269 --> 00:02:15,041
llustration shows the difference between cartoons and animation.

36
00:02:15,043 --> 00:02:16,533
The difference is

37
00:02:16,892 --> 00:02:19,319
you can draw a lot of pieces for cartoons and animation.

38
00:02:19,585 --> 00:02:21,307
And you get to see the character several times.

39
00:02:21,548 --> 00:02:25,083
So, even if it's not unique in design,

40
00:02:25,108 --> 00:02:26,906
there's a place where you can express the charm

41
00:02:26,908 --> 00:02:29,022
of this character.

42
00:02:29,308 --> 00:02:31,885
But on the other hand, what we're doing right now,

43
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,933
or the design that you're going to experience,

44
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:36,508
with just this one piece,

45
00:02:36,533 --> 00:02:38,410
to be honest, all the charm of this character,

46
00:02:38,435 --> 00:02:39,686
even if it's not all the charm,

47
00:02:39,688 --> 00:02:42,035
you need to be able to show most of its charm.

48
00:02:42,194 --> 00:02:44,596
And when you think you have expressed that,

49
00:02:44,621 --> 00:02:46,823
but the viewer doesn't agree,

50
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,496
this could end up being a failed illustration.

51
00:02:49,521 --> 00:02:52,215
Illustration is like a language.

52
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,014
I talk about something and the other person gets it.

53
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,627
From the point of view of going through this process,

54
00:02:57,652 --> 00:02:59,787
in a way, it's a language.

55
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:02,231
I like comparing cooking to drawing.

56
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:05,030
There's a theme for this character,

57
00:03:05,032 --> 00:03:07,754
and according to the recipe you made,

58
00:03:08,029 --> 00:03:09,747
you have to cook and serve it.

59
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,621
But it needs to fit well with the restaurant.

60
00:03:12,104 --> 00:03:14,719
For example, if you open a kimchi stew restaurant,

61
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:18,279
and if you sell omelet rice, that's not too bad.

62
00:03:18,304 --> 00:03:21,606
But it's kind of awkward if they sell spaghetti all of a sudden.

63
00:03:21,783 --> 00:03:26,006
So it's important to make sure

64
00:03:26,031 --> 00:03:28,298
the viewers enjoy it.

65
00:03:28,996 --> 00:03:30,608
If you look at a few designs,

66
00:03:32,903 --> 00:03:36,131
when you look at them, the design of each character,

67
00:03:36,156 --> 00:03:39,231
unlike your expectations,

68
00:03:39,256 --> 00:03:41,850
may not be expressed in detail.

69
00:03:45,281 --> 00:03:47,210
Some may look comfortable,

70
00:03:48,518 --> 00:03:50,744
and some may look simple,

71
00:03:53,935 --> 00:03:57,426
while there are smaller ones.

72
00:03:57,502 --> 00:03:59,516
But what's most important is

73
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:02,187
the first impression of the character.

74
00:04:02,763 --> 00:04:05,029
You may think that this character looks calm

75
00:04:05,552 --> 00:04:07,208
and that it looks formal.

76
00:04:08,187 --> 00:04:10,962
On the other hand, this character could look cheeky.

77
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:16,802
It looks like it is sneaky, but does a good job at the same time.

78
00:04:20,881 --> 00:04:23,865
This one looks like it won't talk much.

79
00:04:24,144 --> 00:04:26,611
This one looks authoritative.

80
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:29,777
You can see these personalities at first glance

81
00:04:30,361 --> 00:04:34,243
and whether you can accept these differences

82
00:04:34,255 --> 00:04:35,599
would be very important in character design.

83
00:04:37,588 --> 00:04:38,483
Therefore,

84
00:04:38,508 --> 00:04:39,790
today, we're going to talk about

85
00:04:39,815 --> 00:04:42,117
how to put it into our design.

86
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,581
Let's go back to the beginning.

87
00:04:45,665 --> 00:04:47,671
Should design be complex?

88
00:04:47,779 --> 00:04:50,316
I don't think so.

89
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,973
Of course, if you are drawing concept art,

90
00:04:52,998 --> 00:04:55,700
and prepare a portfolio,

91
00:04:55,725 --> 00:04:58,869
it's good to draw it in detail, when you make a portfolio.

92
00:04:58,894 --> 00:05:01,273
A portfolio shows

93
00:05:01,298 --> 00:05:03,590
that you can depict things in detail.

94
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,675
So, you would need to have detailed drawings for it.

95
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,341
But, other than that, it's not necessary.

96
00:05:08,425 --> 00:05:09,908
Then what do you need?

97
00:05:09,983 --> 00:05:11,694
It doesn't have to be complicated.

98
00:05:11,719 --> 00:05:13,367
But there's one thing you need instead.

99
00:05:13,392 --> 00:05:14,912
It's tempo adjustment.

100
00:05:17,075 --> 00:05:19,696
Some people say it's about controlling strengths and weaknesses.

101
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:25,185
Some people talk about the rhythm of the design.

102
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,810
What are these strengths and weaknesses?

103
00:05:26,885 --> 00:05:30,158
Even if the design is widely spread,

104
00:05:30,183 --> 00:05:33,112
there needs to be a point where we can focus.

105
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,702
Let's talk about the three elements of the illustration again.

106
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:43,898
Point, line, and plane.

107
00:05:46,475 --> 00:05:50,623
The planes are what determine the overall first impression.

108
00:05:51,015 --> 00:05:53,138
How do the clothes look?

109
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:55,952
Is the middle area hollowed out?

110
00:05:55,977 --> 00:05:58,223
Or are there a lot of accessories?

111
00:05:59,565 --> 00:06:01,352
Are the clothes spread out?

112
00:06:01,563 --> 00:06:04,502
Or do they stick to the character?

113
00:06:04,885 --> 00:06:06,702
The overall plane arrangement

114
00:06:06,727 --> 00:06:09,065
decides the character's first impression.

115
00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:12,385
Now, the linear elements

116
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,335
induce the gaze.

117
00:06:14,494 --> 00:06:16,585
And if there are points,

118
00:06:16,691 --> 00:06:18,743
the gaze would stop there.

119
00:06:18,818 --> 00:06:20,610
Let's look at an example.

120
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,210
If we're looking at this character on the left,

121
00:06:24,235 --> 00:06:27,375
our eyes would follow the black areas

122
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,498
and our gaze would stop

123
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:32,029
at the skin area in the middle.

124
00:06:32,304 --> 00:06:34,223
And the parts where the eyes stop,

125
00:06:34,248 --> 00:06:37,119
you can assign parts

126
00:06:37,144 --> 00:06:37,956
to show off your character's sexiness.

127
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:39,510
It's an element to make

128
00:06:39,535 --> 00:06:42,819
the overall impression of the character sexy.

129
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:45,077
Or the one on the right side,

130
00:06:45,102 --> 00:06:48,533
I'm going to place the key elements in between,

131
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:51,729
to make it easy to focus.

132
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,988
You can design a nice illustration,

133
00:06:55,013 --> 00:06:57,322
through linear elements

134
00:06:57,381 --> 00:06:59,120
and point elements.

135
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:01,718
That means, these point elements,

136
00:07:01,815 --> 00:07:05,458
it'd be good if you can focus more on them compared to other things.

137
00:07:06,917 --> 00:07:10,512
Let's say there are detailed designs in this part.

138
00:07:10,537 --> 00:07:12,371
It has complicated designs.

139
00:07:12,396 --> 00:07:15,069
Then it needs to be a lot more complicated than it is now.

140
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,752
Otherwise, although it's an item that needs to draw attention,

141
00:07:18,777 --> 00:07:20,519
it can't play that role.

142
00:07:20,802 --> 00:07:23,154
So, it's only a relative thing.

143
00:07:23,156 --> 00:07:26,581
The more complicated this side is, the more complicated it has to be.

144
00:07:26,606 --> 00:07:28,395
If it looked simple,

145
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,149
this much is fine.

146
00:07:31,575 --> 00:07:33,475
So what's important about design is,

147
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,375
it doesn't have to be complicated.

148
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,044
If it's a complicated section,

149
00:07:38,494 --> 00:07:41,183
place fewer elements where you want the eyes to take a break.

150
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:44,152
It's very important to control the strengths and weaknesses.

151
00:07:44,869 --> 00:07:47,485
There are a lot of interesting designs that use this.

152
00:07:48,527 --> 00:07:50,792
If you look at well-designed illustrations,

153
00:07:50,817 --> 00:07:54,023
if you observe the strong and weak elements,

154
00:07:54,048 --> 00:07:56,100
you'll be able to see some pretty interesting illustrations.

155
00:07:57,567 --> 00:08:01,083
To give an example of weakness,

156
00:08:01,085 --> 00:08:03,804
for this one, the middle part...

157
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,546
if they were all black,

158
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:11,602
it wouldn't be too bad, but it could have looked a bit bland.

159
00:08:11,835 --> 00:08:13,790
I'm going to change this area to skin.

160
00:08:13,815 --> 00:08:17,671
And you can place elements that are used for dolls on the skin.

161
00:08:17,696 --> 00:08:18,978
It looks like it was broken.

162
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,200
And by giving a strong impression in the center,

163
00:08:22,225 --> 00:08:25,602
it arranges the section that draws attention to the design.

164
00:08:26,498 --> 00:08:29,529
I'm going to use that to add more flavor to my illustration.

165
00:08:30,188 --> 00:08:31,994
This is the control of strength and weakness.

166
00:08:32,988 --> 00:08:36,179
What you need is your charm.

167
00:08:37,021 --> 00:08:38,923
In the end, the character that you drew

168
00:08:38,948 --> 00:08:40,810
needs to be able to approach people in a charming way.

169
00:08:40,877 --> 00:08:42,852
For those who want to work in the field,

170
00:08:42,877 --> 00:08:44,158
it should be commercially popular.

171
00:08:44,183 --> 00:08:46,075
It's a selling point.

172
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,917
Can you actually sell this?

173
00:08:47,942 --> 00:08:50,292
People often ask me if I can sell it for money.

174
00:08:50,317 --> 00:08:52,456
Then, where does its charm come from?

175
00:08:52,481 --> 00:08:54,079
There can be a lot of things.

176
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,308
Where can we find charm?

177
00:08:56,908 --> 00:08:58,860
It's going to be connected with an important point.

178
00:08:58,885 --> 00:09:00,458
Charm is very important.

179
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:03,496
If the answer for both is charm,

180
00:09:03,521 --> 00:09:05,093
where will this charm come from?

181
00:09:05,204 --> 00:09:08,100
Should it just look pretty?

182
00:09:10,887 --> 00:09:12,742
Or is it the setting?

183
00:09:17,969 --> 00:09:20,825
Colors can be a part of the visual elements.

184
00:09:22,042 --> 00:09:24,577
There could be a lot of things like that.

185
00:09:24,602 --> 00:09:26,519
Actually, all of these are included.

186
00:09:27,296 --> 00:09:30,106
It's important how well the combination works,

187
00:09:30,494 --> 00:09:33,865
using all of them.

188
00:09:34,298 --> 00:09:36,044
Of course, it has to look pretty,

189
00:09:36,069 --> 00:09:38,300
and the setting,

190
00:09:38,301 --> 00:09:42,296
how much the character design shows personality

191
00:09:42,321 --> 00:09:45,175
when it comes to showing off your charm,

192
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,447
it plays an important role.

193
00:09:46,481 --> 00:09:49,637
Then what should we do

194
00:09:49,662 --> 00:09:51,362
to put this setting

195
00:09:51,387 --> 00:09:55,412
in that pretty visual element?

196
00:09:55,787 --> 00:09:58,422
In a way, it could be very simple.

197
00:09:58,481 --> 00:10:00,542
It's a story.

198
00:10:03,581 --> 00:10:05,215
In the end, the story

199
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,333
means that you need to be able to put it in the visual element.

200
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,998
Let's draw this and talk about it.

201
00:10:13,515 --> 00:10:15,981
I think it's going to contain a very majestic story,

202
00:10:16,006 --> 00:10:17,621
but it's not such a big deal.

203
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:25,762
Here's a simple-looking wizard.

204
00:10:26,099 --> 00:10:28,960
Today, we're going to adjust this around,

205
00:10:28,985 --> 00:10:31,021
and put it in a unique style.

206
00:10:31,022 --> 00:10:33,415
The charm that I mentioned earlier,

207
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,329
we are going through the way to expresss it intensively.

208
00:10:35,354 --> 00:10:36,652
I'm going to talk about it from now on.

209
00:10:36,777 --> 00:10:38,367
In the previous lecture, we were talking about

210
00:10:38,702 --> 00:10:41,412
the gaze and silhouettes.

211
00:10:41,597 --> 00:10:43,265
How to draw hair lumps.

212
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:44,260
How the wind blows.

213
00:10:44,262 --> 00:10:46,100
We learned these things.

214
00:10:46,181 --> 00:10:47,918
So, by using those,

215
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,203
in this class we will learn how to apply them.

216
00:10:50,392 --> 00:10:53,717
Let's use them to decorate this.

217
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,552
I copied and pasted the character.

218
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:05,542
Let's take a look at it part by part.

219
00:11:10,752 --> 00:11:13,133
Just in case, let's make the screen bigger.

220
00:11:19,162 --> 00:11:20,421
First of all,

221
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:23,092
I said give it a story.

222
00:11:23,117 --> 00:11:26,616
Let's find out exactly what story means.

223
00:11:26,783 --> 00:11:29,479
The story seems really majestic.

224
00:11:29,504 --> 00:11:30,667
But to be honest, it's nothing.

225
00:11:30,692 --> 00:11:33,427
This is a normal wizard now.

226
00:11:34,335 --> 00:11:36,406
Let's add the story here.

227
00:11:36,681 --> 00:11:38,244
How do you put it in?

228
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:40,450
Let's look at the character's universe.

229
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,306
For example, this character

230
00:11:42,331 --> 00:11:43,831
Let's go for an alternate historical background first.

231
00:11:43,856 --> 00:11:45,071
Let's say it's a fantasy,

232
00:11:45,096 --> 00:11:46,550
or science fiction.

233
00:11:46,794 --> 00:11:49,665
Depending on what it is, the design will change a lot.

234
00:11:49,915 --> 00:11:51,215
For example, this has

235
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,997
a science-fantasy like design that we can see often

236
00:11:53,998 --> 00:11:56,430
in mobile games these days.

237
00:11:56,455 --> 00:11:58,900
If it's a science-fantasy design,

238
00:11:58,925 --> 00:12:00,213
how will it change?

239
00:12:00,805 --> 00:12:01,884
For example,

240
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:08,507
the character's wand could be more mechanical.

241
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,809
Because the crystal ball

242
00:12:17,869 --> 00:12:21,036
in the middle looks like it's for fantasy settings.

243
00:12:25,903 --> 00:12:28,182
We could replace it with a small jewel

244
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,966
to make it look like it's from a science-fantasy game.

245
00:12:42,991 --> 00:12:47,319
Or, because it's in a science-fantasy setting, we can place belts around it.

246
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,337
Because the trend these days is techwear.

247
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:52,507
You can change the clothing

248
00:12:53,728 --> 00:12:55,498
so that it looks like techwear.

249
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,805
Or, this is something used for fantasy too, but,

250
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,248
we can also use it here because it is casual style.

251
00:13:04,273 --> 00:13:07,030
You can make the inside of the hair shine.

252
00:13:12,409 --> 00:13:15,494
What pops into your mind when we say there's a sci-fi magician?

253
00:13:15,969 --> 00:13:17,711
You could draw drones.

254
00:13:18,582 --> 00:13:21,363
Usually, wizards speak in European languages.

255
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:26,373
Because it's in a sci-fi setting, you can draw drones

256
00:13:26,415 --> 00:13:27,813
that look futuristic.

257
00:13:29,486 --> 00:13:31,209
Things that look like this,

258
00:13:40,928 --> 00:13:43,793
or two of the same things are going around,

259
00:13:43,882 --> 00:13:47,517
or you can give the two drones personality,

260
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:54,246
to change the design.

261
00:13:55,219 --> 00:13:57,521
While doing one more sci-fi thing,

262
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,937
I can add more elements.

263
00:14:00,971 --> 00:14:03,285
I did some details with the wand,

264
00:14:03,361 --> 00:14:06,330
and there's a techwear bracelet on the arm,

265
00:14:07,496 --> 00:14:11,071
or drones in the back,

266
00:14:11,362 --> 00:14:14,321
so, with this kind of concept,

267
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:17,942
there will be more elements for the character.

268
00:14:18,109 --> 00:14:21,654
Let's use the ones that are attractive only.

269
00:14:21,905 --> 00:14:24,502
You will be able to add to your character's own charm.

270
00:14:24,678 --> 00:14:27,725
So when you go into the design, the story part,

271
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:29,698
the more I think about it,

272
00:14:30,346 --> 00:14:33,083
you can add a lot of charm to it.

273
00:14:33,142 --> 00:14:36,063
How should I study to think about things like this?

274
00:14:36,088 --> 00:14:38,232
Let's talk about it briefly.

275
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:41,234
It's a thought process.

276
00:14:44,005 --> 00:14:48,396
Like a word chain game, keep saying the words that come to mind.

277
00:14:48,523 --> 00:14:51,128
There was a game like this in the past.

278
00:14:51,153 --> 00:14:54,333
If you go to a convenience store, there are... and...

279
00:14:54,334 --> 00:14:57,917
Similar to that, I thought of sci-fi.

280
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,659
What could you come up with when it comes to science fiction?

281
00:14:59,684 --> 00:15:01,188
A mechanical wand.

282
00:15:02,186 --> 00:15:03,173
What else?

283
00:15:03,232 --> 00:15:04,421
Drones.

284
00:15:04,882 --> 00:15:06,487
There's something else called techwear.

285
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:08,527
What else could come up?

286
00:15:08,611 --> 00:15:12,227
If there are numbers and symbols, it seems like sci-fi.

287
00:15:12,403 --> 00:15:15,767
For example, like this,

288
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:18,828
or something like this.

289
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,142
I don't know why, but there are four or one in there.

290
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:28,498
If you have that, it can be sci-fi-like.

291
00:15:28,632 --> 00:15:31,078
There are point colors,

292
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,353
and shiny items,

293
00:15:39,588 --> 00:15:42,509
luminous items that are rare in real life.

294
00:15:51,236 --> 00:15:52,928
Or you can use metal.

295
00:15:53,334 --> 00:15:55,196
What else is there when it comes to science fiction?

296
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,167
That's how you should think about it.

297
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,200
The more you can write it down,

298
00:16:01,225 --> 00:16:03,103
the more it will help you design.

299
00:16:04,232 --> 00:16:05,486
Then this is the first one.

300
00:16:05,511 --> 00:16:07,548
The first way was to apply the story.

301
00:16:08,148 --> 00:16:11,223
Now let's dig into the details.

302
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,832
There are points, lines, and planes.

303
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:21,213
Let's think about planes first.

304
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:24,388
I'm going to apply my personality to this character.

305
00:16:25,892 --> 00:16:28,456
The personality that came out after the story,

306
00:16:28,468 --> 00:16:29,819
I'm going to put it in.

307
00:16:29,877 --> 00:16:32,892
This character has a calm impression.

308
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:35,455
For the first time, I'm going to play a calm character.

309
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,609
Let's move on.

310
00:16:37,175 --> 00:16:40,148
Being calm and the position that comes out of the game is

311
00:16:40,173 --> 00:16:42,400
not like the final boss.

312
00:16:42,475 --> 00:16:45,113
It would be a wizard

313
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:48,544
who's just finished their apprenticeship

314
00:16:48,728 --> 00:16:51,598
and was hired as a new recruit.

315
00:16:51,623 --> 00:16:53,967
Let's design it like that.

316
00:16:54,594 --> 00:16:56,558
When we learned about the silhouette in the previous lecture,

317
00:16:56,667 --> 00:17:00,323
remember triangle, diamond, 8-shaped compositions. We learned about them a lot.

318
00:17:00,432 --> 00:17:03,530
What was the one that gives you a calm impression?

319
00:17:04,073 --> 00:17:05,330
It was a triangle.

320
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,084
Then, we are going to apply a triangle silhouette

321
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:10,527
to the character's outfit,

322
00:17:10,603 --> 00:17:12,635
but if it looks too calm,

323
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:14,515
it may look like a great wizard.

324
00:17:16,626 --> 00:17:21,311
With a long white beard,

325
00:17:21,344 --> 00:17:23,586
it will look as if it's going to use sophisticated magic.

326
00:17:23,611 --> 00:17:25,942
So, let's avoid using the triangular silhouette.

327
00:17:25,955 --> 00:17:30,544
Then what should we do?

328
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,925
Let's mix triangles and diamonds.

329
00:17:33,292 --> 00:17:34,405
Let's move on.

330
00:17:38,571 --> 00:17:41,757
I'm going to make the outfit on this arm float a bit more.

331
00:17:47,915 --> 00:17:50,263
Previously, I told you that with clothes,

332
00:17:50,288 --> 00:17:52,492
it's better to make

333
00:17:52,517 --> 00:17:53,705
long hands.

334
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:56,073
Talking about deformers,

335
00:18:09,373 --> 00:18:13,346
if you want to prepare something like concept art,

336
00:18:13,371 --> 00:18:15,704
there's one thing you have to think about at this stage.

337
00:18:15,972 --> 00:18:17,816
When you work on concept art,

338
00:18:17,873 --> 00:18:21,412
depending on the specifications of the game you're going to work on,

339
00:18:21,592 --> 00:18:26,256
there are a lot of times when you can't work on the design.

340
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:29,506
For example, this design right now,

341
00:18:29,531 --> 00:18:31,666
if you look at it in 3D, it's a skirt,

342
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,465
but there are a lot of areas where the sleeves overlap.

343
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,642
You might need to change the design.

344
00:18:37,017 --> 00:18:40,733
If it's overlapped, when you observe it in the game,

345
00:18:40,758 --> 00:18:42,398
it makes it look awkward.

346
00:18:42,423 --> 00:18:44,333
Or your arms can go through your body,

347
00:18:44,483 --> 00:18:46,900
or whenever the character moves their arm, the skirt may be lifted.

348
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:48,350
It ends up flipping a lot.

349
00:18:48,992 --> 00:18:52,500
I'm sure people who play games have experienced this before.

350
00:18:53,025 --> 00:18:56,148
Some items are restricted so that you can't do that.

351
00:18:56,173 --> 00:19:00,202
If you're studying for an examination for concept art,

352
00:19:00,227 --> 00:19:03,800
when it comes to the specifications of the game,

353
00:19:03,825 --> 00:19:07,142
It's good to remember the parts that you can't express.

354
00:19:07,283 --> 00:19:10,298
It's hard to express the see-through style.

355
00:19:10,323 --> 00:19:13,646
Or items that have a lot of layers.

356
00:19:13,896 --> 00:19:18,042
Or if the design is too flat and you just put in the pattern,

357
00:19:18,067 --> 00:19:20,225
sometimes it may look ugly in 3D.

358
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:23,777
It'll be even better

359
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:26,700
if you think about a lot of items with limitations.

360
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,833
Let's keep going.

361
00:19:30,508 --> 00:19:32,106
Let's change our facial expressions a little bit.

362
00:19:32,108 --> 00:19:34,873
So to make it a bit calmer than now,

363
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:39,935
when we have the word 'calm' in mind,

364
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,392
and when we ask ourselves if it's closer to being cute or pretty,

365
00:19:42,417 --> 00:19:43,579
being calm would be closer to being pretty.

366
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:46,613
This is a quick review with faces.

367
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,204
When we want to draw a beautiful face,

368
00:19:51,237 --> 00:19:54,592
we need to add detail to the facial features.

369
00:19:57,352 --> 00:19:59,483
I'm going to depict the eyelashes.

370
00:20:04,898 --> 00:20:08,027
To make the first impression look pretty,

371
00:20:08,052 --> 00:20:09,244
retouch the eye area a bit more.

372
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:20,288
I think it'd be good if there was a cute element, too.

373
00:20:20,313 --> 00:20:22,442
The hairband will add to that part.

374
00:20:23,273 --> 00:20:24,710
I'll put one in.

375
00:20:30,285 --> 00:20:33,723
I'll make the silhouette as wide as possible,

376
00:20:36,212 --> 00:20:38,221
to increase the casualness.

377
00:20:38,513 --> 00:20:41,562
I'm going to add the silhouette of the hair.

378
00:20:42,863 --> 00:20:44,946
Overall, it's a triangle silhouette

379
00:20:44,971 --> 00:20:47,341
and a diamond silhouette,

380
00:20:47,425 --> 00:20:49,444
The character has a more wizard-like vibe.

381
00:20:49,469 --> 00:20:51,104
You'll be able to see that it's getting closer.

382
00:20:51,321 --> 00:20:53,717
Compared to the existing complete apprenticeship wizard,

383
00:20:53,742 --> 00:20:55,831
it looks like a wizard with a certain level.

384
00:20:56,406 --> 00:20:57,581
If you are done up to here,

385
00:20:57,606 --> 00:21:00,553
we've cleared the first assignment I wanted to go through.

386
00:21:02,056 --> 00:21:04,504
I wanted to make the hat a little longer,

387
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,081
and raise the level.

388
00:21:11,921 --> 00:21:14,029
Let's fix the silhouette of the weapon now.

389
00:21:14,388 --> 00:21:17,496
As I said before, I want to upgrade the level.

390
00:21:17,521 --> 00:21:20,217
It'd be nice if the weapon looks heavy.

391
00:21:23,004 --> 00:21:26,348
From here, it's good to refer to references,

392
00:21:26,835 --> 00:21:28,160
such as illustration materials.

393
00:21:28,185 --> 00:21:30,419
It might be better to refer to those things.

394
00:21:31,094 --> 00:21:35,148
I'm filming a class video right now.

395
00:21:35,181 --> 00:21:36,490
So I can't look at the references.

396
00:21:39,623 --> 00:21:43,090
You students are not filming, so take a look at the references.

397
00:21:43,448 --> 00:21:44,669
Feel free to use them.

398
00:21:44,902 --> 00:21:46,748
But this is sci-fi.

399
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:48,879
It's the only concept we have.

400
00:21:48,904 --> 00:21:51,087
It's going to be hard to give it a unique design.

401
00:21:51,315 --> 00:21:54,429
Then should I add one more setting?

402
00:21:54,663 --> 00:21:56,492
Let's go back to that point.

403
00:21:59,177 --> 00:22:01,250
What kind of setting can we apply to it?

404
00:22:01,367 --> 00:22:04,439
We put the numbers in.. What else comes to mind when you think of numbers?

405
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,025
You can give

406
00:22:07,703 --> 00:22:09,283
an experiment-like vibe to it.

407
00:22:10,321 --> 00:22:12,604
I came up with a calm character.

408
00:22:15,297 --> 00:22:17,225
While thinking of a calm character,

409
00:22:17,492 --> 00:22:20,490
If I can give the impression of a laboratory,

410
00:22:20,515 --> 00:22:22,748
is it going to be a bit dark?

411
00:22:26,367 --> 00:22:28,935
I don't want to make it look dark.

412
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,719
You may just put an animal in it.

413
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,144
Sharks,

414
00:22:34,983 --> 00:22:35,975
or another animal,

415
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:40,508
or plants and fruits,

416
00:22:40,533 --> 00:22:42,771
they're very unique items.

417
00:22:42,796 --> 00:22:46,419
With this alternate history, these items...

418
00:22:46,444 --> 00:22:50,796
In other words, if there's a strong point to the design,

419
00:22:50,821 --> 00:22:53,932
the character's design brings out its identity.

420
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:56,219
I'm going to put an element to this character.

421
00:22:56,244 --> 00:22:58,796
Let's put in a shark.

422
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,085
I can make the side blue,

423
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,965
but if I were to put in a conceptual shark,

424
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,621
you can change the form of the shark's mouth like this.

425
00:23:32,853 --> 00:23:38,177
Except for the belt here,

426
00:23:57,608 --> 00:23:59,508
you can make it into an eye shape,

427
00:24:05,121 --> 00:24:07,984
or in this section, you can put shark teeth,

428
00:24:17,858 --> 00:24:20,725
or you can make the character's teeth sharp.

429
00:24:26,823 --> 00:24:28,771
Other than that,

430
00:24:28,796 --> 00:24:31,179
maybe make a headband which looks like the shape of a shark.

431
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:45,342
With the concept of the shark,

432
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,869
design elements that can be used for characters that have already been added.

433
00:24:49,402 --> 00:24:53,519
The reason why I think about the story is to use the elements of design,

434
00:24:53,981 --> 00:24:57,592
in a variety of things.

435
00:24:57,617 --> 00:24:58,973
Moreover,

436
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:02,604
by using the plane elements that we saw earlier,

437
00:25:02,629 --> 00:25:04,710
the character's identity is increasing more and more.

438
00:25:05,273 --> 00:25:08,774
Let's do the drones parting around us like fish.

439
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:13,252
Because the character has a shark concept, the drones can look like flying fish.

440
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:19,915
A flying fish...

441
00:25:28,004 --> 00:25:35,019
So change the design of the wand here,

442
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:47,348
apply the shape of a shark's teeth,

443
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:56,817
or you can put a fin on the back.

444
00:26:12,765 --> 00:26:14,032
By using the concept of a shark,

445
00:26:14,044 --> 00:26:15,664
we're going to keep adding something.

446
00:26:15,798 --> 00:26:18,283
But the silhouette information that I mentioned earlier,

447
00:26:18,308 --> 00:26:22,988
while maintaining the shape of a diamond in the triangle,

448
00:26:23,396 --> 00:26:26,454
and since it's a calm setting, the overall silhouette

449
00:26:26,479 --> 00:26:30,454
isn't sharp and it doesn't stick out a lot.

450
00:26:30,479 --> 00:26:34,900
Don't go like this at the end.

451
00:26:34,925 --> 00:26:38,340
If it sticks out, it makes it look aggressive.

452
00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:41,897
It'd be nice to reduce those parts little by little.

453
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:46,100
Let's reduce it bit by bit.

454
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:55,588
So we've handled the planes from among the points, lines, and planes.

455
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:57,769
Let's look at the points and the lines,

456
00:26:57,794 --> 00:27:00,983
Let's think about the section where we need to focus our attention.

457
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:04,771
People will see the face and the hat.

458
00:27:04,796 --> 00:27:07,669
And they are going to come down to the center and spread out on both sides.

459
00:27:07,694 --> 00:27:08,602
Along the sleeve,

460
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:11,685
with the gaze that widened like that,

461
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:13,914
the legs will be separated a little bit.

462
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:16,710
It's separated,

463
00:27:17,185 --> 00:27:18,732
so this is a separate part.

464
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:21,921
Then choose the section

465
00:27:21,946 --> 00:27:24,038
where you want people to focus their attention.

466
00:27:25,548 --> 00:27:27,650
Choose the section where you want to

467
00:27:27,652 --> 00:27:29,623
draw the viewer's attention beforehand.

468
00:27:29,694 --> 00:27:33,006
Do we want people to pay attention to the shoulders?

469
00:27:33,881 --> 00:27:36,458
Since you put these letters in, it'd be nice if they pay attention to them.

470
00:27:37,008 --> 00:27:39,298
We need to draw attention to the weapon design, too.

471
00:27:39,598 --> 00:27:43,846
Do you want people to look at the legs a little bit,

472
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:45,860
but not the feet?

473
00:27:46,223 --> 00:27:47,833
Or if people never pay attention to the part you wanted,

474
00:27:48,138 --> 00:27:50,438
then let's adjust it accordingly.

475
00:27:51,246 --> 00:27:53,133
In the section where people should look at first,

476
00:27:53,308 --> 00:27:57,102
we're going to use a point color that's more visible.

477
00:27:58,369 --> 00:28:02,450
When designing, things like black and white,

478
00:28:02,708 --> 00:28:04,943
they're not exactly considered as colors.

479
00:28:05,271 --> 00:28:10,510
We literally say they are achromatic.

480
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:12,915
Since it's not colored, it's achromatic.

481
00:28:13,356 --> 00:28:15,729
Since these are achromatic colors,

482
00:28:15,754 --> 00:28:17,993
just with the detailed design,

483
00:28:18,005 --> 00:28:18,966
compared to other places,

484
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:24,206
It also plays a role as a point.

485
00:28:25,681 --> 00:28:30,260
Like this, in the section you wanted,

486
00:28:30,285 --> 00:28:33,433
you can arrange it so that people pay attention to it.

487
00:28:39,202 --> 00:28:41,510
If you want people to look

488
00:28:41,535 --> 00:28:43,133
at the legs a little bit,

489
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:48,433
add gradation like this.

490
00:28:52,983 --> 00:28:54,890
If there's a gradation,

491
00:28:54,915 --> 00:28:57,269
it will be more visible than before.

492
00:29:05,361 --> 00:29:08,138
And I want the wand part to be seen clearly.

493
00:29:24,988 --> 00:29:30,708
Then by adding a point color,

494
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:38,930
or a linear element,

495
00:29:39,088 --> 00:29:41,288
that will draw attention to this side,

496
00:29:41,496 --> 00:29:43,665
for example, an effect.

497
00:29:45,944 --> 00:29:48,400
If this effect is coming out here,

498
00:29:48,425 --> 00:29:50,257
it'll catch people's eyes.

499
00:29:59,785 --> 00:30:01,096
By using these kinds of things,

500
00:30:01,121 --> 00:30:02,129
we are making a point where we can concentrate

501
00:30:02,154 --> 00:30:05,392
on this character.

502
00:30:10,277 --> 00:30:12,279
Apply it on the feet just a little bit.

503
00:30:12,281 --> 00:30:14,942
Since it's awkward if you only use the top part,

504
00:30:14,944 --> 00:30:16,362
I'm going to apply it on the bottom as well.

505
00:30:16,364 --> 00:30:18,937
We didn't want to focus on the feet.

506
00:30:19,104 --> 00:30:21,486
So I'm going to add just a little bit.

507
00:30:38,206 --> 00:30:39,569
What else can we do?

508
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:42,348
Since it's a shark,

509
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:55,031
you can put the tail in,

510
00:30:55,056 --> 00:30:57,507
or you can draw the shape of the teeth on the clothes.

511
00:30:58,806 --> 00:31:01,875
It's the thinking process again, the shark thing that keeps coming to mind.

512
00:31:03,298 --> 00:31:07,213
The teeth, pointed eyes, flying fish,

513
00:31:08,592 --> 00:31:09,796
and the tail,

514
00:31:10,596 --> 00:31:12,394
it all came to mind from there.

515
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:22,715
That's the way you make up the design.

516
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:29,344
Let's take a look at before and after.

517
00:31:29,619 --> 00:31:30,448
Before,

518
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:31,473
and after.

519
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:33,525
The character is definitely

520
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,601
more unique.

521
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:38,029
Between the first impression of the character on the left,

522
00:31:38,054 --> 00:31:40,048
and the first impression of the character on the right,

523
00:31:40,073 --> 00:31:42,131
the two feel different.

524
00:31:42,381 --> 00:31:45,513
The one with the intense first impression will be the one on the left.

525
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:50,300
When you look at the game character,

526
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,563
I told you that you need to feel

527
00:31:52,588 --> 00:31:54,183
what kind of charm this character has.

528
00:31:54,433 --> 00:31:55,733
So, when we say that,

529
00:31:55,758 --> 00:31:57,660
the character with a first impression so strong

530
00:31:57,685 --> 00:32:00,035
that we can predict its personality

531
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:01,613
and actions

532
00:32:01,638 --> 00:32:04,387
would be the one on the left.

533
00:32:04,604 --> 00:32:06,552
So when you design it, like this,

534
00:32:06,577 --> 00:32:08,006
put in the story,

535
00:32:08,031 --> 00:32:10,608
and adjust the silhouette according to the personality,

536
00:32:10,633 --> 00:32:12,977
or adjust points, lines, and planes,

537
00:32:13,002 --> 00:32:14,658
by drawing people's attention,

538
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:16,969
use all the things we've learned so far.

539
00:32:16,994 --> 00:32:20,158
So it's important to use those things to organize it.

540
00:32:20,292 --> 00:32:22,954
In a way, this is what I wanted to say today.

541
00:32:22,979 --> 00:32:24,377
And it's the most important part.

542
00:32:24,402 --> 00:32:28,250
This part would be related to creating the universe of the story, as I mentioned before.

543
00:32:28,275 --> 00:32:29,908
The ability to write a story,

544
00:32:29,933 --> 00:32:33,473
for those who practice concept art,

545
00:32:33,498 --> 00:32:35,556
can be a very important thing.

546
00:32:35,581 --> 00:32:37,506
For those who draw fan art,

547
00:32:37,531 --> 00:32:40,400
you don't have to pay much attention to it.

548
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:42,721
Why is this important for people who draw concept art?

549
00:32:42,746 --> 00:32:45,190
If you work in the concept art field,

550
00:32:45,192 --> 00:32:47,448
you could be the director of the art team.

551
00:32:47,473 --> 00:32:49,883
Although you could turn into a freelancer later on,

552
00:32:49,908 --> 00:32:52,938
either way,

553
00:32:52,963 --> 00:32:54,233
some of you may want to be a leader.

554
00:32:54,258 --> 00:32:57,498
For those people, this ability is especially important.

555
00:32:57,523 --> 00:33:01,329
The ability to imagine the entire scene while creating a universe,

556
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:03,154
something that the viewers can understand,

557
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:05,685
the ability to form that kind of universe itself

558
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:09,419
in a way, from the perspective of an art designer,

559
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:12,294
it's a skill that is emphasized a lot in the field.

560
00:33:13,002 --> 00:33:14,517
It's one of my personal episodes, but,

561
00:33:14,542 --> 00:33:17,179
a long time ago, someone asked me

562
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:18,719
to be their company's art director.

563
00:33:18,744 --> 00:33:22,315
Their content provider told me that

564
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:25,390
because they think I can create a universe

565
00:33:25,415 --> 00:33:26,985
they felt that

566
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:29,052
I would be a suitable art director.

567
00:33:29,077 --> 00:33:32,513
When I heard that, I realized that

568
00:33:32,538 --> 00:33:36,731
that kind of skill would be important for character designers.

569
00:33:37,323 --> 00:33:40,481
So, people should be accepting of your designs

570
00:33:40,506 --> 00:33:43,920
and you should be able to put what you want into the designs.

571
00:33:43,997 --> 00:33:46,792
I began to think that these two things are important,

572
00:33:46,817 --> 00:33:49,133
and I wanted to emphasize them to students.

573
00:33:49,158 --> 00:33:51,177
So, let's design characters once more.

574
00:33:51,202 --> 00:33:53,208
Because doing just one example is a bit boring.

575
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,204
what should we do next?

576
00:34:01,511 --> 00:34:04,202
We're going to make different settings.

577
00:34:05,308 --> 00:34:07,683
What can you think up?

578
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:11,117
If you're just watching this lecture, imagine

579
00:34:11,142 --> 00:34:14,108
what you can add to this character in your head.

580
00:34:14,133 --> 00:34:20,013
I previously made a sci-fi character, so I'll make a character from a fantasy setting.

581
00:34:21,096 --> 00:34:24,276
I'm going to draw a fantasy character.

582
00:34:24,277 --> 00:34:26,256
But, how should I do this?

583
00:34:26,402 --> 00:34:28,977
We just created fish, remember.

584
00:34:29,336 --> 00:34:33,292
So, I'm thinking of a mobile game

585
00:34:33,317 --> 00:34:37,548
where underwater creatures were the main concept.

586
00:34:37,902 --> 00:34:39,513
With these mobile games

587
00:34:39,538 --> 00:34:41,313
that are set in a deep sea background,

588
00:34:41,315 --> 00:34:43,456
the contrast of black and white is evident,

589
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:45,531
and there was a strong

590
00:34:46,023 --> 00:34:47,279
point color.

591
00:34:47,304 --> 00:34:49,835
There were a lot of characters

592
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:53,637
with extremely white skin color

593
00:34:53,763 --> 00:34:55,712
or with very lowly saturated skin colors.

594
00:34:55,788 --> 00:34:59,035
I think those designs are unique.

595
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:00,606
So, let's apply

596
00:35:02,704 --> 00:35:04,615
the underwater setting.

597
00:35:05,397 --> 00:35:09,835
I'd like to tell you that it's good to practice design as much as you can.

598
00:35:09,917 --> 00:35:12,763
It's kind of sad that I have to tell you

599
00:35:12,787 --> 00:35:13,777
to practice as much as you can.

600
00:35:13,802 --> 00:35:14,808
But that's the reality.

601
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:16,481
So, if you have experience,

602
00:35:16,506 --> 00:35:20,231
there are more things that you can draw.

603
00:35:20,256 --> 00:35:23,460
That's why you need to practice with many different examples.

604
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:29,046
First, I'm going to lower the overall saturation.

605
00:35:30,855 --> 00:35:42,121
I'll make the black robes into white robes.

606
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:51,983
I'm going to create a mad character

607
00:35:52,175 --> 00:35:54,127
which is very different from the previous calm character.

608
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,996
But, the key color will be the same.

609
00:35:59,363 --> 00:36:01,373
The key colors would still be

610
00:36:01,375 --> 00:36:04,360
the mint color and the blue color

611
00:36:04,385 --> 00:36:05,231
that I used previously.

612
00:36:05,256 --> 00:36:09,048
I'll make the character into a mad character.

613
00:36:10,698 --> 00:36:12,488
Because we need to practice with different examples.

614
00:36:40,196 --> 00:36:42,917
Let's modify the facial expressions first.

615
00:36:57,921 --> 00:37:00,579
To create a strong impression with the eyes as well,

616
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:04,452
I'll detail them more, unlike when it was a calm and pretty one.

617
00:37:05,027 --> 00:37:07,019
Then, the eyes would be emphasized.

618
00:37:11,506 --> 00:37:14,929
Let's draw sharp teeth.

619
00:37:23,285 --> 00:37:25,850
I think putting in dark circles would be good, too.

620
00:37:28,841 --> 00:37:30,083
With the overall silhouette,

621
00:37:30,108 --> 00:37:32,890
the previous one had a triangular one.

622
00:37:32,915 --> 00:37:34,242
For the one we're using now,

623
00:37:34,267 --> 00:37:36,698
we don't have to use a triangular silhouette to give a calm impression.

624
00:37:36,723 --> 00:37:39,217
So, let's change the design starting with the sleeves

625
00:37:39,692 --> 00:37:42,604
to make a diamond-shaped robe.

626
00:37:50,665 --> 00:37:52,329
I'll open this area

627
00:37:57,183 --> 00:37:58,992
to make the robe lighter.

628
00:38:04,896 --> 00:38:07,325
It's good to change the pose, too.

629
00:38:32,133 --> 00:38:34,289
When we're designing,

630
00:38:34,302 --> 00:38:35,532
even the postures

631
00:38:35,556 --> 00:38:37,902
have a huge impact on the character's first impression.

632
00:38:38,502 --> 00:38:39,708
So, when you're practicing alone,

633
00:38:39,733 --> 00:38:41,977
it will be good to

634
00:38:42,002 --> 00:38:43,042
control everything and practice.

635
00:38:49,385 --> 00:38:52,035
Let's make the hair pointy

636
00:38:52,067 --> 00:38:53,878
to show the character's temper.

637
00:38:53,896 --> 00:38:56,051
The overall silhouette will be very pointy.

638
00:38:58,092 --> 00:39:01,435
Let's pause a bit and talk about the silhouette.

639
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,000
What is the silhouette?

640
00:39:04,483 --> 00:39:07,016
Let's go over it once more.

641
00:39:07,125 --> 00:39:09,504
I covered it last time,

642
00:39:09,529 --> 00:39:11,375
but there's no harm in knowing this.

643
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:13,567
In the end, it's this.

644
00:39:13,592 --> 00:39:16,108
If it's sharp, it gives a sharp impression.

645
00:39:16,383 --> 00:39:18,796
If it's square, it'll make a strong impression on the character.

646
00:39:18,996 --> 00:39:21,629
If it's round, it'll make a cute impression.

647
00:39:21,654 --> 00:39:24,135
If it's curved, it'll make a flexible impression.

648
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,485
That's how it works.

649
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:28,902
What's important is how it's combined,

650
00:39:28,904 --> 00:39:31,744
and maintained.

651
00:39:32,268 --> 00:39:33,367
What I'm saying right now is

652
00:39:33,392 --> 00:39:35,896
this character is a bit sharp,

653
00:39:36,421 --> 00:39:39,092
but with a loose sharpness.

654
00:39:39,117 --> 00:39:42,302
It's a bit cranky, but it's usually quiet.

655
00:39:42,304 --> 00:39:43,746
It feels like it lacks sleep,

656
00:39:43,889 --> 00:39:45,102
it gives that kind of impression.

657
00:39:45,127 --> 00:39:48,727
It's not a very sharp silhouette.

658
00:39:48,994 --> 00:39:52,253
It's kind of sharp, but it maintains a somewhat loose feeling.

659
00:39:52,617 --> 00:39:55,196
So it can go in with the same silhouette.

660
00:39:55,508 --> 00:39:59,267
And if there's a part that breaks the silhouette,

661
00:39:59,727 --> 00:40:02,725
or if there's a part where it's slightly off,

662
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:06,896
we need to check out whether we can apply these silhouettes

663
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:09,465
to those sections or not.

664
00:40:09,777 --> 00:40:12,839
For example, even a hat like this,

665
00:40:13,835 --> 00:40:16,156
we look down at the end of the hat,

666
00:40:16,869 --> 00:40:19,185
or I said it will be a droopy silhouette.

667
00:40:21,996 --> 00:40:23,813
So that you can feel that,

668
00:40:27,225 --> 00:40:29,702
you can draw it droopy like this way down.

669
00:40:31,575 --> 00:40:33,079
In every single detail,

670
00:40:33,186 --> 00:40:35,627
We're going to use the drooping silhouette.

671
00:40:38,739 --> 00:40:40,537
I'll loosen up one side like this,

672
00:40:41,623 --> 00:40:44,200
so that you can include these settings, too

673
00:41:03,063 --> 00:41:06,384
and I'm going to rip off the end of the outfit.

674
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,708
The material setting of the outfit is also

675
00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:11,029
one of the important things that you can set up.

676
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:12,433
It's good to use it together.

677
00:41:12,592 --> 00:41:14,346
It's not that difficult.

678
00:41:14,371 --> 00:41:16,483
If the character is a bit dark,

679
00:41:16,508 --> 00:41:18,002
you may tear the edges apart,

680
00:41:20,154 --> 00:41:23,855
or if you're a strong character, you can make the outfit thicker.

681
00:41:23,857 --> 00:41:24,948
It's like that.

682
00:41:32,746 --> 00:41:34,753
I tried to use fantasy settings.

683
00:41:34,778 --> 00:41:37,300
Don't use too much techwear or things like that.

684
00:41:41,086 --> 00:41:42,696
But there's one thing you can use instead.

685
00:41:42,819 --> 00:41:44,453
I can't use it in sci-fi,

686
00:41:44,478 --> 00:41:46,512
but it's something that can be used in fantasy effectively.

687
00:41:46,696 --> 00:41:48,646
Curved metals.

688
00:41:48,863 --> 00:41:50,582
Why can't I use it in sci-fi?

689
00:41:50,607 --> 00:41:53,190
It's simple, it has a strong fantasy vibe.

690
00:41:54,782 --> 00:41:56,446
So the curved metal is

691
00:41:56,471 --> 00:41:59,903
the exclusive property of fantasy characters.

692
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,382
It's an element that I like, too.

693
00:42:02,407 --> 00:42:05,228
I can't use it when I draw sci-fi characters as well.

694
00:42:05,253 --> 00:42:06,232
It's one of the items that I can't use in sci-fi.

695
00:42:10,688 --> 00:42:12,103
First of all,

696
00:42:40,371 --> 00:42:44,144
I think it'll be good to show the arms like this.

697
00:42:46,113 --> 00:42:48,481
To show a somewhat violent personality,

698
00:42:48,506 --> 00:42:51,342
the normal arm warmers have a very calm impression.

699
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:54,967
I'll change them to a half glove.

700
00:42:55,994 --> 00:42:58,525
Adjust it to make the character look violent.

701
00:43:01,865 --> 00:43:04,230
And I'm going to change the design of the skirt.

702
00:43:04,232 --> 00:43:05,296
Which one would be good?

703
00:43:05,596 --> 00:43:08,213
If you cover it up like this, the character becomes too calm.

704
00:43:08,971 --> 00:43:11,589
It's a bit different from what I want to do now.

705
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,096
Therefore, I'm going to make it wider.

706
00:43:17,104 --> 00:43:19,879
And as expected,

707
00:43:22,281 --> 00:43:24,215
you have to tear the ends a bit to maintain the character's impression.

708
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:30,108
These days, even if it's fantasy,

709
00:43:30,133 --> 00:43:32,010
there are a lot of fusion styles of fantasy.

710
00:43:33,265 --> 00:43:35,499
Fantasy with a bit of sci-fi.

711
00:43:35,935 --> 00:43:37,819
So, as time goes by,

712
00:43:37,844 --> 00:43:42,521
it's not like we're preparing a portfolio for fantasy.

713
00:43:42,546 --> 00:43:44,801
These days, people often prepare a lot for science fiction.

714
00:43:44,803 --> 00:43:48,312
The actual number of outsourced orders is also increasing for sci-fi.

715
00:43:48,788 --> 00:43:52,076
So, there are students

716
00:43:52,078 --> 00:43:53,194
who are into fantasy only.

717
00:43:53,219 --> 00:43:57,463
It's sad, but it's time for you to prepare for sci-fi.

718
00:43:57,488 --> 00:43:59,016
I think it's a good decision.

719
00:43:59,058 --> 00:44:01,388
On the other hand, if you're interested in science fiction only,

720
00:44:01,413 --> 00:44:02,592
or you are not into fantasy at all,

721
00:44:02,617 --> 00:44:03,773
those of you who are doing that,

722
00:44:03,798 --> 00:44:06,194
I recommend you

723
00:44:06,219 --> 00:44:07,733
to work on this side, too.

724
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:10,027
You'll use it someday.

725
00:44:10,668 --> 00:44:14,210
You'll use it someday and you'll have to study various fields,

726
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:15,752
so you can do it from the other side.

727
00:44:16,492 --> 00:44:17,700
There's something like this.

728
00:44:19,523 --> 00:44:21,217
You can improvise in drawing female characters

729
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:22,883
and by drawing muscular male characters.

730
00:44:23,013 --> 00:44:25,304
And by studying perspective from a background,

731
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,527
you can make a character more three-dimensional.

732
00:44:27,935 --> 00:44:31,744
Likewise, improving in one area can help with the other areas.

733
00:44:36,571 --> 00:44:38,513
You can use round metals for this character.

734
00:44:38,538 --> 00:44:40,597
Again, we want to make the gaze focus

735
00:44:40,823 --> 00:44:43,302
on this area.

736
00:44:43,756 --> 00:44:47,122
I think placing a belt around this character

737
00:44:47,147 --> 00:44:47,897
would be fine.

738
00:44:47,922 --> 00:44:51,867
But, this pocket makes the character look like

739
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,323
it's from a rural village, not the deep sea.

740
00:44:55,348 --> 00:44:56,629
So, let's delete this.

741
00:44:59,692 --> 00:45:01,318
What else can we do?

742
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,994
If we're creating a character from under the sea,

743
00:45:04,019 --> 00:45:07,519
you can also use teeth.

744
00:45:07,727 --> 00:45:09,410
But, we already drew in teeth for the shark.

745
00:45:09,435 --> 00:45:11,975
Now, let's create a different mood.

746
00:45:12,713 --> 00:45:16,039
I'll make the center of the hat black.

747
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:20,260
I'll also add the teeth here.

748
00:45:29,502 --> 00:45:32,650
The hat would droop down compared to the one on the left.

749
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,539
Alternatively, we can make a hat

750
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:46,115
that goes upwards.

751
00:45:48,492 --> 00:45:51,929
I'll make the head droop down.

752
00:45:55,894 --> 00:45:58,642
Some deep sea fish use bait.

753
00:46:01,283 --> 00:46:02,829
So, this character could

754
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:04,931
look just like that.

755
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:13,043
We can add more teeth to this area.

756
00:46:18,194 --> 00:46:20,771
These fractured designs

757
00:46:20,796 --> 00:46:23,006
are also characteristics of deep sea characters.

758
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:25,635
So, let's use these elements as well.

759
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:34,215
You could add black veins to the side.

760
00:46:46,105 --> 00:46:49,906
To describe the character's personalities more in detail,

761
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:52,988
because the previous boots had a calm silhouette,

762
00:46:53,013 --> 00:46:56,533
let's draw boots that stick together and are pointing upwards.

763
00:47:00,577 --> 00:47:01,808
The important thing is the silhouette.

764
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:04,756
Because it's a silhouette that goes generally upwards,

765
00:47:04,781 --> 00:47:07,352
it would be much less calm than the previous one.

766
00:47:18,027 --> 00:47:20,019
If we use the creatures, too,

767
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:21,984
because we used drones on the left,

768
00:47:21,986 --> 00:47:23,381
remember how this character's a fantasy character?

769
00:47:23,406 --> 00:47:25,985
Then, instead of machine parts,

770
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,733
creatures would be much more adequate.

771
00:47:28,221 --> 00:47:31,677
Because it would be good to draw a monstrous character,

772
00:47:41,064 --> 00:47:42,187
like this,

773
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,329
we can draw something like Cthulhu.

774
00:47:52,004 --> 00:47:54,923
If you don't know what it is, search for it.

775
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:07,190
It may look like I'm just drawing,

776
00:48:07,215 --> 00:48:08,554
but actually, I'm drawing the teeth.

777
00:48:42,594 --> 00:48:44,219
They look a bit gross, but still,

778
00:48:44,244 --> 00:48:46,325
I can add eyes like this.

779
00:49:04,263 --> 00:49:07,425
And if we change the design of the wand like that,

780
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,781
it should be curved

781
00:49:10,806 --> 00:49:13,590
because we're going for a fantasy setting instead of a sci-fi setting.

782
00:49:14,502 --> 00:49:16,415
To give a fantasy vibe,

783
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,306
curved silhouettes would be better than linear ones.

784
00:49:19,981 --> 00:49:21,004
Accordingly,

785
00:49:33,919 --> 00:49:35,531
I'll do it like this,

786
00:49:37,598 --> 00:49:38,821
or design it like this,

787
00:49:42,975 --> 00:49:44,392
with the same character,

788
00:49:44,417 --> 00:49:46,104
the design can change this much.

789
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,698
From the same character on the right,

790
00:49:49,723 --> 00:49:52,188
the design of the characters on the left and the center,

791
00:49:52,213 --> 00:49:53,839
becomes definitely different.

792
00:49:53,881 --> 00:49:57,240
That's how you look at the process and we call it a variation.

793
00:49:57,265 --> 00:49:59,125
When it comes to variations,

794
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:02,202
with the same concept, we're increasing the amount of design.

795
00:50:02,227 --> 00:50:06,023
For example, if this is 1, 2,

796
00:50:06,048 --> 00:50:10,600
1-2 and 1-3, that's what we're going to do.

797
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:13,135
In a way, these things,

798
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,623
belong to a wide variation.

799
00:50:15,648 --> 00:50:19,554
According to the settings you want,

800
00:50:19,556 --> 00:50:22,221
depending on your personality and story,

801
00:50:22,463 --> 00:50:25,561
by adjusting it, you keep increasing the amount.

802
00:50:25,737 --> 00:50:28,418
If you increase the amount, it becomes a pattern.

803
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:30,346
It's your data.

804
00:50:30,371 --> 00:50:33,504
It will be used for the actual performance.

805
00:50:34,171 --> 00:50:37,238
So I hope you build up as many things as possible.

806
00:50:37,263 --> 00:50:38,540
It's good to practice.

807
00:50:38,565 --> 00:50:41,421
If you're going to follow me through this process,

808
00:50:41,446 --> 00:50:44,618
I hope you design one.

809
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:46,298
You don't have to be so detailed.

810
00:50:46,323 --> 00:50:48,608
It's enough to be like the character on the right.

811
00:50:48,806 --> 00:50:52,785
It's okay to have a simple design like this.

812
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:55,196
Let's make it pretty in your eyes.

813
00:50:55,221 --> 00:50:57,725
I hope you try to give it a sense of storytelling.

814
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:01,127
I hope you make a design like that.

815
00:51:01,252 --> 00:51:02,938
What I designed today is

816
00:51:02,963 --> 00:51:04,519
going to be used later on,

817
00:51:05,419 --> 00:51:08,295
to continue with the illustration work.

818
00:51:08,479 --> 00:51:11,920
I need to think about which one would be better.

819
00:51:12,004 --> 00:51:13,177
Let's wrap this up.

820
00:51:15,681 --> 00:51:18,785
Today, we had a time to study design.

821
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:20,333
What's important about design is,

822
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:24,118
first, it doesn't have to be complicated.

823
00:51:24,185 --> 00:51:27,348
Instead, by using the tempo control,

824
00:51:27,373 --> 00:51:32,017
it's better to divide the concentration section.

825
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:36,996
Check if it's a clear section

826
00:51:37,021 --> 00:51:40,637
that draws attention from these designs, later on.

827
00:51:40,838 --> 00:51:43,394
Check out the designs you've done yourself.

828
00:51:43,419 --> 00:51:45,746
There are certain parts that draw attention.

829
00:51:46,046 --> 00:51:48,910
That's how you control your strength.

830
00:51:48,935 --> 00:51:50,435
So you can be a good design.

831
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:53,292
Of course, there's a need for some detail in the process.

832
00:51:53,317 --> 00:51:55,156
For those who are preparing for the portfolio,

833
00:51:55,181 --> 00:51:57,929
it's good to practice in detail, too.

834
00:51:59,221 --> 00:52:01,602
What's important about design?

835
00:52:01,604 --> 00:52:03,788
The most important thing is charm.

836
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:06,565
But there are so many things that create that charm.

837
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:09,204
The silhouette itself can be charming,

838
00:52:09,229 --> 00:52:11,146
if the character just looks pretty,

839
00:52:11,171 --> 00:52:13,639
or if it has a pretty face, that's part of the design.

840
00:52:13,823 --> 00:52:17,125
It's also important how attractive the character looks.

841
00:52:17,596 --> 00:52:19,322
I didn't tell you before.

842
00:52:19,406 --> 00:52:20,796
When I was in the process of designing,

843
00:52:20,809 --> 00:52:21,932
the color of the character's skin color

844
00:52:21,944 --> 00:52:23,882
changed a little bit.

845
00:52:24,185 --> 00:52:25,988
Even the skin color is part of the design.

846
00:52:26,013 --> 00:52:28,573
We're not designing outfits,

847
00:52:28,598 --> 00:52:30,396
but a character design.

848
00:52:30,421 --> 00:52:32,415
The color of this character's skin is strong.

849
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,421
Why is the saturation low?

850
00:52:33,446 --> 00:52:35,916
Yellow, red, or black?

851
00:52:35,918 --> 00:52:37,133
Depending on these things,

852
00:52:37,158 --> 00:52:39,451
the character's impression changes.

853
00:52:39,453 --> 00:52:42,802
We get into the design by adjusting each one of them.

854
00:52:44,383 --> 00:52:46,513
How do you practice this?

855
00:52:46,804 --> 00:52:48,260
Variation.

856
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:50,059
Based on the same character,

857
00:52:50,127 --> 00:52:52,019
the story that

858
00:52:52,193 --> 00:52:53,608
you imagined,

859
00:52:53,675 --> 00:52:57,400
I hope you think about it and add more stories to your thoughts.

860
00:52:57,425 --> 00:52:59,402
By adding some settings,

861
00:52:59,427 --> 00:53:02,514
checking the conditions compared to what you imagined,

862
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:06,239
or whether people interpret it the same way,

863
00:53:06,315 --> 00:53:08,090
keep testing those things.

864
00:53:08,115 --> 00:53:10,702
It's important to practice the design.

865
00:53:10,827 --> 00:53:14,029
The quantity matters in design. The more you try, the more experience you get.

866
00:53:14,072 --> 00:53:16,914
That becomes your own know-how.

867
00:53:17,106 --> 00:53:20,394
So, I can't help this part. We just have to draw a lot.

868
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:23,633
Especially for those who thought that design was difficult,

869
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:27,031
I hope you think about that today.

870
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:29,392
I talked about a lot of things today.

871
00:53:29,417 --> 00:53:32,140
To be honest, I just decorated my wizard character

872
00:53:32,165 --> 00:53:34,633
according to my taste.

873
00:53:34,733 --> 00:53:36,727
I just added the settings that I wanted to add.

874
00:53:36,985 --> 00:53:39,021
And there's a little theory added to it.

875
00:53:39,110 --> 00:53:42,888
So I recommend that you try it without being scared off.

876
00:53:43,321 --> 00:53:44,839
That's all for today.

877
00:53:44,864 --> 00:53:46,735
Next time, by using this,

878
00:53:47,196 --> 00:53:49,205
let's draw an illustration.

879
00:53:49,207 --> 00:53:52,219
Of course, we will go through the subject of light before that.

880
00:53:52,756 --> 00:53:54,223
See you in the next class.
