00:00:05,914 --> 00:00:06,984
Hello.

3
00:00:07,093 --> 00:00:09,271
From today, in Section 2

4
00:00:09,296 --> 00:00:12,625
we are going to learn the basics.

5
00:00:12,703 --> 00:00:15,310
The contents of Section 2 are about the basics.

6
00:00:15,335 --> 00:00:17,769
So we'll go over the basics.

7
00:00:17,794 --> 00:00:19,660
Since this is about the basics,

8
00:00:19,662 --> 00:00:22,937
our goal is not to understand everything at once,

9
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:24,903
but instead,

10
00:00:24,928 --> 00:00:26,794
repeating what you learn

11
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:29,833
to make it yours.

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,466
So in this lecture,

13
00:00:31,491 --> 00:00:35,003
rather than understanding the theoretical content,

14
00:00:35,028 --> 00:00:38,919
the things that help you to practice

15
00:00:38,944 --> 00:00:42,261
how how you should study

16
00:00:42,286 --> 00:00:43,285
make up the main content.

17
00:00:43,287 --> 00:00:46,535
So I hope you will study hard.

18
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,403
Although my class focuses on the practical parts,

19
00:00:50,428 --> 00:00:53,440
if you want to cover the basics,

20
00:00:53,442 --> 00:00:57,505
take notes while you're going through Section 2.

21
00:00:57,622 --> 00:01:02,513
Because today, we'll start looking at the human body.

22
00:01:04,419 --> 00:01:06,435
You can't skip the human body section,

23
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,708
which is about studying the basics of a character.

24
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:11,794
It's the first part we are going to study.

25
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:14,669
Some may start drawing the face first.

26
00:01:15,614 --> 00:01:17,510
Although that is important,

27
00:01:17,512 --> 00:01:19,630
we will start with body parts first.

28
00:01:21,286 --> 00:01:24,903
They are as important as the facial part.

29
00:01:25,403 --> 00:01:27,540
When we draw the body,

30
00:01:27,542 --> 00:01:29,964
it's connected with the facial part.

31
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:32,195
So we will put that off to the end

32
00:01:32,196 --> 00:01:33,731
and it's one of the most difficult parts as well.

33
00:01:34,021 --> 00:01:35,911
It's the biggest obstacle

34
00:01:35,936 --> 00:01:37,825
and the first obstacle we have to meet.

35
00:01:39,911 --> 00:01:42,888
I'm going to tell you what I emphasize the most.

36
00:01:43,685 --> 00:01:45,716
When I draw the human body,

37
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:48,208
I draw a mannequin.

38
00:01:50,396 --> 00:01:51,513
The process

39
00:01:53,692 --> 00:01:56,005
of drawing a mannequin in your head

40
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,277
is important.

41
00:01:58,302 --> 00:01:59,521
So what does it mean?

42
00:02:00,396 --> 00:02:02,128
In the process of drawing from the previous lecture,

43
00:02:02,153 --> 00:02:05,153
the first process was the composition.

44
00:02:05,294 --> 00:02:06,672
In the process of the composition,

45
00:02:06,673 --> 00:02:09,208
we move our characters in our heads.

46
00:02:09,614 --> 00:02:12,292
If the moving character is a blur

47
00:02:12,317 --> 00:02:13,747
and unclear,

48
00:02:13,772 --> 00:02:15,176
you will face glitches

49
00:02:15,178 --> 00:02:17,675
when you draw.

50
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,474
So, if the imaginary mannequin

51
00:02:20,499 --> 00:02:27,099
can be imagined accurately

52
00:02:32,013 --> 00:02:37,104
and quickly

53
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,307
the accuracy and stability

54
00:02:41,167 --> 00:02:43,409
of your drawing

55
00:02:43,901 --> 00:02:47,189
will increase.

56
00:02:47,214 --> 00:02:49,471
Therefore, when you draw the human body,

57
00:02:49,496 --> 00:02:53,011
it is really important to imagine the appropriate mannequin in your head.

58
00:02:53,036 --> 00:02:54,675
So this mannequin...

59
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,011
how could we make it?

60
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,901
If you divide the human body into three elements,

61
00:02:57,926 --> 00:02:59,542
the first one is ratio.

62
00:03:02,018 --> 00:03:04,800
And the second one would be movement.

63
00:03:08,182 --> 00:03:09,721
The third one is line.

64
00:03:10,276 --> 00:03:12,776
So I divide the human body like this.

65
00:03:13,307 --> 00:03:16,753
Movement refers to things

66
00:03:16,778 --> 00:03:18,245
like the poses that we take.

67
00:03:18,247 --> 00:03:21,759
And how natural the poses are.

68
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:22,800
For ratio,

69
00:03:22,825 --> 00:03:25,970
most of us draw casual characters

70
00:03:25,995 --> 00:03:28,081
so in that process,

71
00:03:28,106 --> 00:03:30,198
you will need to apply deformers.

72
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:31,729
Deformers

73
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:38,237
are applied to the lines and the ratio,

74
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:40,315
but especially to the ratio.

75
00:03:42,104 --> 00:03:43,526
So when moving on to these deformers,

76
00:03:43,551 --> 00:03:45,659
the ratio will change to some extent.

77
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,729
The easiest thing to know is that the head gets bigger.

78
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,556
Starting with the head,

79
00:03:49,581 --> 00:03:53,386
the ratio of some body parts will change.

80
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:56,096
With proportions, you will learn that.

81
00:03:56,292 --> 00:03:59,073
Then, with a body with the correct proportions,

82
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:01,221
we can draw more charming outlines

83
00:04:01,573 --> 00:04:02,909
such as the muscles

84
00:04:02,934 --> 00:04:03,986
or the bones

85
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:06,462
or the outlines of the finger bones,

86
00:04:06,487 --> 00:04:08,206
the line of the collarbone,

87
00:04:08,503 --> 00:04:10,267
or the line of the chest area,

88
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:11,917
or maybe a line for the waist.

89
00:04:12,104 --> 00:04:15,377
So the line part is

90
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:17,417
about learning the parts that can make

91
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,425
a character be seen as attractive.

92
00:04:22,104 --> 00:04:23,425
Among these three,

93
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,368
if I divide them into level of importance,

94
00:04:26,393 --> 00:04:28,339
movement is the most important thing.

95
00:04:28,995 --> 00:04:30,714
The first step is more important.

96
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:32,307
The importance,

97
00:04:34,221 --> 00:04:35,581
if you prioritize them,

98
00:04:35,606 --> 00:04:37,299
would be 1, 2, and then 3.

99
00:04:38,128 --> 00:04:39,485
So it means,

100
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,759
no matter how well-proportioned you are,

101
00:04:41,784 --> 00:04:44,470
and how pretty your lines are,

102
00:04:44,495 --> 00:04:49,034
it would be funny if I walk in a bridge pose.

103
00:04:50,245 --> 00:04:53,198
It'd be scary if a person who is handsome

104
00:04:53,223 --> 00:04:55,120
and has a pretty body walked around like that.

105
00:04:55,276 --> 00:04:59,790
So to make the movement look natural,

106
00:04:59,815 --> 00:05:01,682
that would be the most important part.

107
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,706
And the next one would be the ratio.

108
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,089
Even if they have pretty muscle lines,

109
00:05:06,284 --> 00:05:10,189
it's hard to say a person with these kind of upper and lower bodies

110
00:05:10,214 --> 00:05:12,589
has a pretty body shape.

111
00:05:13,721 --> 00:05:16,066
Therefore, the ratio

112
00:05:16,068 --> 00:05:17,939
is the second most important part.

113
00:05:17,964 --> 00:05:19,323
And the last one would be the line.

114
00:05:19,348 --> 00:05:22,690
You can actually cover the lines with clothes.

115
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:24,909
Such as a hoodie.

116
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:27,706
You can easily hide them with clothing.

117
00:05:27,792 --> 00:05:29,273
And that's the reason why

118
00:05:29,298 --> 00:05:31,603
it's the third among the three important elements.

119
00:05:31,628 --> 00:05:33,958
Of course, it may depend on the individual.

120
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,303
There are some people

121
00:05:36,305 --> 00:05:37,189
who want to draw sexy illustrations.

122
00:05:37,214 --> 00:05:38,449
So in that case,

123
00:05:38,451 --> 00:05:41,034
human body lines would be more important.

124
00:05:41,081 --> 00:05:42,067
However,

125
00:05:42,069 --> 00:05:45,407
With the premise that we're going to draw a well-balanced body,

126
00:05:45,432 --> 00:05:48,126
the proportions and the movements

127
00:05:48,151 --> 00:05:50,612
would be more important than the outlines.

128
00:05:50,995 --> 00:05:53,581
Today, among those three elements,

129
00:05:53,606 --> 00:05:55,706
we will study the ratio part first.

130
00:05:56,034 --> 00:05:59,003
We won't apply the movements first because

131
00:06:00,917 --> 00:06:03,651
we at least need

132
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:08,159
a stick-figure shape

133
00:06:11,026 --> 00:06:12,548
of a human body.

134
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:15,104
So you can move it freely later on.

135
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:17,181
Before we move it,

136
00:06:17,183 --> 00:06:19,805
let's take some time to make

137
00:06:19,807 --> 00:06:21,221
a mannequin.

138
00:06:23,096 --> 00:06:26,065
And then we're going to go through the lines

139
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:29,212
that we often use when we draw.

140
00:06:29,237 --> 00:06:31,637
And we will handle this movement part in detail

141
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:34,026
in the next class.

142
00:06:35,393 --> 00:06:37,909
Let's do the ratio first.

143
00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:45,803
Before I move on, note that the proportions I show you

144
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,362
are the most common proportions

145
00:06:47,387 --> 00:06:50,302
in casual-style drawings.

146
00:06:50,304 --> 00:06:52,853
So, they won't apply to all illustrations.

147
00:06:52,878 --> 00:06:53,962
Not at all.

148
00:06:53,987 --> 00:06:55,893
So you'll need to fix these proportions later

149
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:58,353
to suit your needs.

150
00:06:58,378 --> 00:07:00,400
Once you remember this ratio,

151
00:07:00,402 --> 00:07:03,571
you will be able to apply this to other illustrations.

152
00:07:03,596 --> 00:07:05,363
Then let's have a look.

153
00:07:05,365 --> 00:07:07,376
So, the female character first.

154
00:07:07,401 --> 00:07:09,628
People often draw female characters

155
00:07:12,714 --> 00:07:15,987
so that the proportion of the head

156
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:22,432
is referred to as 1:2.

157
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,465
But actually, casual characters

158
00:07:31,503 --> 00:07:34,323
tend to have wider faces from side to side.

159
00:07:34,393 --> 00:07:36,800
So it's not exactly 1:2.

160
00:07:36,825 --> 00:07:40,388
But more like 1:1.8

161
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,198
applies.

162
00:07:42,292 --> 00:07:45,415
But sometimes it looks like it's applied as a 2.

163
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,800
So what it means is,

164
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:48,807
the head itself is 1.8.

165
00:07:48,832 --> 00:07:51,612
But the casual characters have thicker hair.

166
00:07:51,612 --> 00:07:51,667
Because of the hair, it often looks like 2.

167
00:07:51,667 --> 00:07:54,604
Because of the hair,

168
00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:56,643
it often looks like 2.

169
00:07:56,979 --> 00:07:58,729
So if you set the ratio of the head,

170
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:02,792
I'm going to measure the entire body from the head.

171
00:08:05,591 --> 00:08:07,511
So you have to measure the neck first.

172
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,784
There's a thing you have to remember when you measure a neck.

173
00:08:10,809 --> 00:08:12,181
The neck looks

174
00:08:12,206 --> 00:08:13,540
totally different in the frontal view

175
00:08:13,565 --> 00:08:15,776
compared to the profile view.

176
00:08:16,104 --> 00:08:20,657
Because our neck is closer to the back of the head,

177
00:08:20,682 --> 00:08:22,760
when I measure the neck length,

178
00:08:22,785 --> 00:08:27,003
I measure the length

179
00:08:27,028 --> 00:08:28,823
from right here, right under the ears.

180
00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:30,710
So if you measure up to this part,

181
00:08:30,712 --> 00:08:32,064
how long would it be?

182
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:33,878
So, usually the length,

183
00:08:34,415 --> 00:08:36,387
when you measure it like this,

184
00:08:36,388 --> 00:08:38,181
the length would be about two-thirds

185
00:08:38,206 --> 00:08:40,454
of the height of the head.

186
00:08:40,455 --> 00:08:41,643
Think of it like that.

187
00:08:41,885 --> 00:08:44,393
So, the length of

188
00:08:44,418 --> 00:08:45,962
about two-thirds of the face

189
00:08:45,987 --> 00:08:47,322
will stick out here

190
00:08:49,706 --> 00:08:51,478
from just under the ears.

191
00:08:51,503 --> 00:08:52,964
We will learn about the exact length of the ears

192
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:56,526
when we handle the facial parts.

193
00:08:57,331 --> 00:09:00,243
Then let's say we set the length of the neck.

194
00:09:00,245 --> 00:09:01,995
And then we have to do the upper body as well.

195
00:09:02,253 --> 00:09:04,596
Here's an important tip.

196
00:09:04,987 --> 00:09:08,062
The first thing

197
00:09:08,064 --> 00:09:11,175
that decides the body ratio

198
00:09:11,479 --> 00:09:13,296
is the width of the shoulders.

199
00:09:13,401 --> 00:09:15,756
Depending on how the shoulder width is captured,

200
00:09:15,757 --> 00:09:17,495
the human body ratio varies.

201
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,300
So you have to remember this part.

202
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:24,011
They say it's 1.5 times bigger than an adult woman

203
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:29,104
with an 8 head count figure.

204
00:09:29,315 --> 00:09:33,377
Usually, one and a half times the length of the head

205
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:34,650
would be the shoulder width.

206
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:36,970
Since this is based on the proportion of 8-head figures,

207
00:09:36,995 --> 00:09:38,737
the shoulders may be too wide to apply it

208
00:09:38,774 --> 00:09:41,718
to a casual character.

209
00:09:41,731 --> 00:09:43,829
Because of this, at first,

210
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,833
I looked at anatomy books to help me study drawing.

211
00:09:45,834 --> 00:09:48,782
So, my female characters at that time had broad shoulders.

212
00:09:48,807 --> 00:09:50,623
As I drew, I kept thinking about it.

213
00:09:50,768 --> 00:09:53,235
Because it's a bit awkward to use this on its own.

214
00:09:53,237 --> 00:09:55,657
We draw the proportions of the 6-7-head figure and that's our casual look.

215
00:09:55,682 --> 00:09:57,908
How much do you have to do

216
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:58,986
to change the body proportions to 6-7?

217
00:09:59,011 --> 00:10:00,511
Not that much.

218
00:10:00,596 --> 00:10:05,706
So you need

219
00:10:05,947 --> 00:10:11,080
about 1.2 to 1.3 times

220
00:10:13,003 --> 00:10:14,307
the length of the head.

221
00:10:14,706 --> 00:10:17,190
So when you put it down like this,

222
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,886
make sure that the shoulder width

223
00:10:19,075 --> 00:10:20,698
is a little longer

224
00:10:21,792 --> 00:10:25,537
than the height of the head.

225
00:10:25,539 --> 00:10:29,604
Then, you'll have a natural shoulder width.

226
00:10:34,793 --> 00:10:39,307
Of course, this width includes the shoulders and the arms, too.

227
00:10:42,112 --> 00:10:44,792
So, I should draw in the arms, too.

228
00:10:45,175 --> 00:10:47,940
Now, let's measure the length of the upper body.

229
00:10:48,112 --> 00:10:50,323
The part where the upper body starts to split,

230
00:10:50,348 --> 00:10:52,682
in other words, the part where the ribs begin to split,

231
00:10:52,707 --> 00:10:56,026
begins at the point

232
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:59,456
with the same length as half of the face's length.

233
00:11:00,768 --> 00:11:04,251
Then, you'll see that this point

234
00:11:04,276 --> 00:11:06,440
is the point where the chest muscles on the ribs start to split.

235
00:11:06,442 --> 00:11:08,893
And the two-thirds of the face's length

236
00:11:09,104 --> 00:11:10,734
is the same length as the neck's length.

237
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:13,112
Let's say this is a two-thirds length of the upper body.

238
00:11:13,113 --> 00:11:15,776
Then, this point would be where the ribs start to split.

239
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:20,214
The chest comes up to half of the upper body.

240
00:11:21,104 --> 00:11:24,490
And the ribs start to split at two-thirds of it.

241
00:11:27,704 --> 00:11:30,128
That's how you would split the ribs.

242
00:11:32,909 --> 00:11:34,165
When you draw a bust,

243
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:38,917
the upper body of a female character is close to a cuboid shape.

244
00:11:40,315 --> 00:11:43,120
And the lower body is more like a trapezoid.

245
00:11:43,526 --> 00:11:45,368
Because they have wider pelvises,

246
00:11:45,393 --> 00:11:46,665
when you draw their body,

247
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:49,918
make sure you draw their lower body

248
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,112
in a trapezoid shape.

249
00:11:51,526 --> 00:11:52,966
On the other hand, for male characters,

250
00:11:52,968 --> 00:11:54,806
since their upper body is a bit wider,

251
00:11:54,831 --> 00:11:57,228
the upper body has an inverted trapezoid shape.

252
00:11:57,253 --> 00:12:01,642
On the other hand, if you lower the lower body in a vertical line,

253
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:04,886
it becomes more like a male character's body shape.

254
00:12:05,518 --> 00:12:06,918
So you need to remember it.

255
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:10,620
Since we finished the upper body,

256
00:12:10,645 --> 00:12:12,085
let's move on to the lower body.

257
00:12:12,087 --> 00:12:15,690
Before that, we need to find the center of the body,

258
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,854
the belly button.

259
00:12:19,034 --> 00:12:21,776
The belly button is the second most important part

260
00:12:21,801 --> 00:12:24,214
of the body proportion.

261
00:12:24,479 --> 00:12:25,698
The first one

262
00:12:25,699 --> 00:12:26,570
was the width of the shoulders.

263
00:12:26,572 --> 00:12:29,057
So the second one would be the belly button.

264
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,487
Let's now see how the belly button would go.

265
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,128
When we're drawing abs, the first row of rectangles

266
00:12:35,175 --> 00:12:37,198
would go over where the ribs are split, like this.

267
00:12:37,909 --> 00:12:43,425
I'll draw in the pectoral muscles like this.

268
00:12:44,987 --> 00:12:47,807
And I'll draw the abs like this.

269
00:12:47,925 --> 00:12:49,307
So, from here,

270
00:12:50,456 --> 00:12:54,237
there would be the first, second, and third row of rectangles

271
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,128
of the abs, and the belly button would come right after that.

272
00:12:57,386 --> 00:12:58,831
But, if you count like this, it's difficult.

273
00:12:58,856 --> 00:13:02,431
If you just want a general position,

274
00:13:02,456 --> 00:13:06,221
just think that the belly button is below the ribs.

275
00:13:07,081 --> 00:13:08,862
If we draw the belly button

276
00:13:08,887 --> 00:13:10,198
after the third rectangle of the abs,

277
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:15,198
the area right above the belly button is the thinnest part of the waist.

278
00:13:15,425 --> 00:13:19,089
So, this would be the waist area.

279
00:13:21,395 --> 00:13:23,917
If you drew the belly button

280
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,073
and the waist,

281
00:13:27,292 --> 00:13:31,753
make sure to pinpoint a new area

282
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:33,151
at the same length to this line.

283
00:13:33,706 --> 00:13:36,321
If you pinpoint this area,

284
00:13:36,346 --> 00:13:39,573
this would be the area where the pelvis starts.

285
00:13:43,238 --> 00:13:44,737
Let's go through it once again.

286
00:13:45,932 --> 00:13:47,532
So the pectoral muscles come first,

287
00:13:47,557 --> 00:13:51,081
with the three layers of the abs below,

288
00:13:52,792 --> 00:13:55,307
and the belly button comes after that.

289
00:13:55,807 --> 00:13:59,620
This line above the belly button is the center of the waist.

290
00:14:02,268 --> 00:14:03,751
So I set it to 1:1

291
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,214
and it makes the pelvis more eye-catching.

292
00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:10,487
A female character's pelvis is a little bigger than the upper body.

293
00:14:11,227 --> 00:14:12,464
So shape it like this.

294
00:14:13,721 --> 00:14:15,690
We are going to measure the length of my pelvis here, too.

295
00:14:15,715 --> 00:14:19,993
We don't set the proportion of the pelvis.

296
00:14:20,018 --> 00:14:22,917
Because it varies

297
00:14:22,942 --> 00:14:24,526
depending on the character's body shape.

298
00:14:24,527 --> 00:14:26,917
For example, a character with a wide pelvis,

299
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,667
or one with long legs,

300
00:14:28,692 --> 00:14:31,729
or a narrow pelvis with thin legs, or maybe

301
00:14:31,754 --> 00:14:33,737
a character with a wide pelvis and long legs.

302
00:14:33,862 --> 00:14:35,906
The lower body changes

303
00:14:35,907 --> 00:14:38,892
in many different ways every time we draw.

304
00:14:38,917 --> 00:14:41,251
We don't specify these parts into numbers.

305
00:14:41,276 --> 00:14:45,204
But, there's still some basics that could help you.

306
00:14:45,205 --> 00:14:46,532
Just remember that

307
00:14:46,557 --> 00:14:50,034
a female character's pelvis is wide, not tall.

308
00:14:50,386 --> 00:14:52,469
On the other hand, male characters will have

309
00:14:52,471 --> 00:14:59,120
a tall pelvis instead of a wide one.

310
00:14:59,307 --> 00:15:02,104
This will help you when you're drawing.

311
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:15,518
But generally, a pelvis

312
00:15:15,543 --> 00:15:16,815
has a longer width than its height.

313
00:15:16,987 --> 00:15:18,841
When drawing the pelvis,

314
00:15:18,843 --> 00:15:21,853
some people say it looks like a heart.

315
00:15:21,878 --> 00:15:24,831
There are some others

316
00:15:25,596 --> 00:15:28,457
who think it looks like a folded Frisbee, like this.

317
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:30,649
All you have to do in the end

318
00:15:30,651 --> 00:15:31,954
is to simplify it to suit your needs.

319
00:15:31,979 --> 00:15:35,432
But, I would recommend you to

320
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,868
draw the pelvis as a heart shape

321
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,307
if possible.

322
00:15:40,714 --> 00:15:43,390
Otherwise, it would be extremely hard

323
00:15:44,669 --> 00:15:46,432
when you're drawing the side view.

324
00:15:50,979 --> 00:15:53,694
It will look really weird like this.

325
00:15:53,695 --> 00:15:56,471
Then why do we have to do such a difficult thing?

326
00:15:56,714 --> 00:15:58,214
We're doing this because it's difficult.

327
00:15:58,276 --> 00:16:02,057
The pelvis part is not as accurate.

328
00:16:02,082 --> 00:16:03,182
If you have to choose the part

329
00:16:04,378 --> 00:16:07,175
where people make the most mistakes,

330
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,948
the first one would be the shoulders,

331
00:16:08,973 --> 00:16:10,768
and the pelvis would be the second.

332
00:16:10,987 --> 00:16:13,417
People often make mistakes here.

333
00:16:13,442 --> 00:16:17,142
When you draw the basic shape,

334
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:19,862
it would be helpful to reduce other errors

335
00:16:19,887 --> 00:16:21,464
if you draw it in detail.

336
00:16:21,901 --> 00:16:23,446
So far,

337
00:16:23,471 --> 00:16:25,666
we went over the pelvis part.

338
00:16:26,654 --> 00:16:28,206
I'll shrink this for now.

339
00:16:30,784 --> 00:16:32,346
Now let's attach the legs.

340
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:37,518
So far, I have the upper and lower body.

341
00:16:37,978 --> 00:16:39,477
The area I just circled,

342
00:16:39,495 --> 00:16:42,345
in other words, the area right under the face and above the legs,

343
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,643
is called the torso.

344
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,829
The torso is one of the areas

345
00:16:47,854 --> 00:16:50,143
that you have to practice the most when drawing the human body.

346
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:52,218
If the length of the arms and legs is incorrect

347
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,765
you can just fix them,

348
00:16:53,766 --> 00:16:55,469
but, if there are errors with the torso,

349
00:16:55,471 --> 00:16:57,620
you have to fix literally everything.

350
00:16:57,753 --> 00:17:01,362
Therefore, when we learn how to draw the mannequin,

351
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:04,025
this torso part will be emphasized a lot.

352
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:05,417
So it'd be good if you remember this.

353
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:08,425
So now you can draw up to the upper body part.

354
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,009
Now we need to put the arms and legs together.

355
00:17:10,034 --> 00:17:11,511
Let's go for the legs first.

356
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:15,382
So I said the length of the legs

357
00:17:15,596 --> 00:17:17,892
is from the belly button to the end of the neck, right below the ears.

358
00:17:17,917 --> 00:17:22,542
Suppose this length is 1.

359
00:17:25,946 --> 00:17:29,158
If you put it twice, it would be the length of the legs.

360
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:32,925
Pull it down like this.

361
00:17:33,388 --> 00:17:35,089
And that was the point.

362
00:17:43,207 --> 00:17:44,604
This would be the knee.

363
00:17:56,399 --> 00:17:57,991
So, up to here,

364
00:17:58,016 --> 00:17:59,056
that would be the thighbone.

365
00:17:59,058 --> 00:18:01,242
But, it excludes the kneecap.

366
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:06,722
This would include the tibia and the fibula.

367
00:18:08,795 --> 00:18:12,439
This ratio is different for each person.

368
00:18:13,068 --> 00:18:14,803
Especially on the legs,

369
00:18:14,967 --> 00:18:16,717
and the lower body,

370
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:19,545
some people draw the thighs a bit longer.

371
00:18:20,248 --> 00:18:23,169
Some people prefer it because

372
00:18:23,171 --> 00:18:24,522
they think the lines of the legs look prettier.

373
00:18:24,662 --> 00:18:27,724
You can take the illustrator PiKA

374
00:18:28,638 --> 00:18:30,388
as an example.

375
00:18:30,413 --> 00:18:32,849
But, remember that

376
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,374
the upper part and lower part of a leg

377
00:18:35,376 --> 00:18:36,701
has the same length.

378
00:18:36,795 --> 00:18:38,904
This applies to the arms as well.

379
00:18:39,693 --> 00:18:43,740
That's why I drew them like this.

380
00:18:45,662 --> 00:18:47,443
If you draw the legs,

381
00:18:56,253 --> 00:18:58,511
they will be around this long.

382
00:18:58,659 --> 00:19:01,620
Then we need to measure the length of the arms.

383
00:19:01,784 --> 00:19:05,297
The length of the arm starts from the belly button as well.

384
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:06,956
So now you can understand why the belly button is important.

385
00:19:08,269 --> 00:19:11,495
It's in anatomy theory that the length of the elbow

386
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,159
goes up to the belly button.

387
00:19:13,184 --> 00:19:14,659
Frankly speaking,

388
00:19:14,684 --> 00:19:16,589
starting from the center of a face,

389
00:19:17,534 --> 00:19:20,316
if you draw a circle around the belly button,

390
00:19:21,003 --> 00:19:25,050
it means that your elbows fit into that circle.

391
00:19:25,402 --> 00:19:26,792
When you move your arm around,

392
00:19:28,581 --> 00:19:32,105
it will meet the belly button at some points.

393
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:35,171
To put it simply, there is an arm around the belly button.

394
00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:38,925
You can think that

395
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,150
there's an elbow slightly above the belly button.

396
00:19:40,175 --> 00:19:43,206
If we keep in mind that the upper and lower part have the same length,

397
00:19:43,912 --> 00:19:45,068
the length of these two arms

398
00:19:49,728 --> 00:19:51,222
would be about this much.

399
00:19:51,378 --> 00:19:55,105
So, the wrist will come up to the hips.

400
00:19:55,503 --> 00:19:57,620
When we attach the hands

401
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,952
like this,

402
00:20:01,954 --> 00:20:05,691
it would usually come up to the middle of the thighs.

403
00:20:07,011 --> 00:20:09,937
Now, with this proportion,

404
00:20:09,938 --> 00:20:13,433
you can apply this to most casual-style characters.

405
00:20:14,706 --> 00:20:15,955
Now we are done with the female character.

406
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,808
You should draw a male character as well.

407
00:20:18,074 --> 00:20:19,895
There are not many differences.

408
00:20:19,897 --> 00:20:22,816
There are a lot of identical theories you can apply.

409
00:20:23,308 --> 00:20:25,183
So if you match them up,

410
00:20:30,719 --> 00:20:33,113
of course the ratio of the faces are identical.

411
00:20:35,261 --> 00:20:37,230
You could draw the top and bottom a little longer.

412
00:20:37,255 --> 00:20:39,408
Because we applied deformers to the female character

413
00:20:39,433 --> 00:20:40,939
to make the face's height smaller,

414
00:20:40,964 --> 00:20:43,308
we won't have to do that to a male character.

415
00:20:43,386 --> 00:20:45,611
First, there's a difference in the thickness of the neck.

416
00:20:45,636 --> 00:20:49,097
With female characters, we'll go over this part in detail

417
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:51,433
when we draw the eyes in Chapter 5.

418
00:20:51,581 --> 00:20:52,999
When we're drawing the eyes,

419
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,518
the pupil of the eye would be here.

420
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,689
And this would be the part within the pupils.

421
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:59,464
A male character's neck would be the width

422
00:20:59,489 --> 00:21:00,613
of these canthi on the outside.

423
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,386
It's really thick, right?

424
00:21:02,472 --> 00:21:06,651
Because male characters usually have more neck muscles,

425
00:21:06,653 --> 00:21:08,283
their neck would usually be

426
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,081
this thick.

427
00:21:10,206 --> 00:21:12,441
Of course, if they're young

428
00:21:12,466 --> 00:21:15,456
or if they don't have a lot of muscles, it could change a bit.

429
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,722
The length of the neck stays the same.

430
00:21:21,441 --> 00:21:23,409
But, male and female characters would have different shoulder lengths.

431
00:21:23,411 --> 00:21:27,159
For female characters, the shoulder length is 1.2-1.3 times the face's length.

432
00:21:27,184 --> 00:21:31,003
For male characters, it would be 2 times the face's length if it's an 8-head figure.

433
00:21:31,394 --> 00:21:32,753
But, we need to draw less broad shoulders

434
00:21:32,778 --> 00:21:34,230
because we're designing a character.

435
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,324
So, the shoulders with deformers applied

436
00:21:37,349 --> 00:21:41,019
are 1.7-1.8 times the length of the face.

437
00:21:41,972 --> 00:21:45,111
If it's a mature character, make the length about 1.8 times longer.

438
00:21:45,136 --> 00:21:47,402
And if it's younger, make it 1.7 times longer.

439
00:21:47,427 --> 00:21:48,784
Keep that in mind.

440
00:21:49,925 --> 00:21:52,105
So, when you place the head horizontally,

441
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:52,869
you can see that the shoulders

442
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:55,480
are a bit shorter than two heads combined.

443
00:21:57,909 --> 00:21:59,831
That would be the proportions of the shoulders.

444
00:22:01,495 --> 00:22:06,105
Like we did with the female character, the ribs would start to split

445
00:22:06,214 --> 00:22:07,542
at the two-thirds length of the face.

446
00:22:08,691 --> 00:22:09,978
Like I mentioned before,

447
00:22:10,003 --> 00:22:13,128
male characters tend to have broader upper bodies.

448
00:22:13,605 --> 00:22:18,620
So, make sure you have

449
00:22:18,706 --> 00:22:20,631
a flipped trapezoid shape.

450
00:22:20,633 --> 00:22:22,027
Now, let's split the ribs.

451
00:22:24,667 --> 00:22:26,202
The overall appearance would be similar.

452
00:22:26,635 --> 00:22:28,394
Pinpoint the belly button

453
00:22:33,682 --> 00:22:34,980
and divide it by 1:1.

454
00:22:38,756 --> 00:22:40,488
Then you need to catch the pelvis part.

455
00:22:45,425 --> 00:22:47,199
As I said,

456
00:22:47,628 --> 00:22:55,628
make it taller instead of wider.

457
00:22:58,427 --> 00:22:59,652
And raise it a little bit.

458
00:23:04,994 --> 00:23:06,493
Then the length of the legs.

459
00:23:12,407 --> 00:23:17,602
Measure the length from the belly button to the end of the neck

460
00:23:24,197 --> 00:23:25,338
by 1:1.

461
00:23:59,267 --> 00:24:01,345
If you hold it like this,

462
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:05,080
shorten the length of the legs a little bit.

463
00:24:09,791 --> 00:24:12,400
So you will get the proportion that can be used in a casual fashion.

464
00:24:13,517 --> 00:24:14,836
Based on this, I think it's safe to say that

465
00:24:14,861 --> 00:24:17,123
you just change it slightly

466
00:24:17,125 --> 00:24:20,674
depending on the character's body type you draw.

467
00:24:23,908 --> 00:24:25,390
So we went through the ratio

468
00:24:25,392 --> 00:24:28,164
of both male and female characters.

469
00:24:28,189 --> 00:24:31,977
Now let's take a look at some of the detail lines

470
00:24:32,002 --> 00:24:33,478
that apply to this ratio.

471
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,932
We are especially going to focus on the lines

472
00:24:38,934 --> 00:24:40,367
where we make the most mistakes.

473
00:24:40,392 --> 00:24:42,860
But the theory we are learning today would be less than

474
00:24:42,885 --> 00:24:45,893
10 percent of the anatomy theory that you can find online.

475
00:24:45,895 --> 00:24:48,258
While I teach students online,

476
00:24:48,283 --> 00:24:50,454
we are limited in time.

477
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:52,375
It's extremely short.

478
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,339
Since I can't teach a ton of information

479
00:24:55,341 --> 00:24:57,469
in a short term,

480
00:24:57,494 --> 00:25:00,067
I focus on the actual content

481
00:25:00,069 --> 00:25:01,820
that I can deliver effectively.

482
00:25:01,845 --> 00:25:05,041
Therefore, I've reduced the basics.

483
00:25:05,043 --> 00:25:08,289
So, if you want to study more about this subject,

484
00:25:08,314 --> 00:25:10,742
make sure to read books.

485
00:25:10,744 --> 00:25:14,255
That will help you a lot.

486
00:25:14,257 --> 00:25:16,869
So if you want to learn about anatomy in detail,

487
00:25:16,894 --> 00:25:20,103
I recommend you to read related books.

488
00:25:20,236 --> 00:25:23,087
Today, we're going to study the human body,

489
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:25,436
and let's check the parts where we often make mistakes.

490
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:27,681
What do you think those are?

491
00:25:28,135 --> 00:25:29,274
As I said,

492
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:31,688
the first part where there a lot of errors happen is the shoulders.

493
00:25:31,713 --> 00:25:33,228
And the pelvis is after that.

494
00:25:33,392 --> 00:25:36,010
They look really weird in the drawing process.

495
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,924
So let's handle the shoulders first.

496
00:25:38,064 --> 00:25:40,931
The shoulders are made up of three bones.

497
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,338
The first part is the collarbone.

498
00:25:48,197 --> 00:25:50,322
The second part is the scapula.

499
00:25:50,347 --> 00:25:53,217
The scapula is triangular, and it's attached to your back.

500
00:25:54,389 --> 00:25:56,697
The scapula looks like this.

501
00:25:58,693 --> 00:26:01,049
It kind of looks like what I drew.

502
00:26:03,702 --> 00:26:07,861
And under here, there would be the shoulder joints.

503
00:26:10,241 --> 00:26:12,653
These three bones make up the shoulder.

504
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:16,640
Because the ribs are separate from the shoulder bones,

505
00:26:17,374 --> 00:26:21,349
we can raise our shoulders up and down.

506
00:26:21,374 --> 00:26:25,215
Basically, with ribs, just because we breathe in air,

507
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:26,843
they won't move along with our upper body.

508
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:31,435
Because our ribs are supposed to protect the intestines,

509
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:34,429
if the ribs move too easily,

510
00:26:34,454 --> 00:26:36,015
it will be very unstable.

511
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:37,968
So, the ribs won't move or budge.

512
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:41,027
However, the collarbone, the scapula, and the shoulder joints

513
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:42,734
can move or be moved.

514
00:26:43,031 --> 00:26:44,182
What would that mean for us?

515
00:26:44,184 --> 00:26:46,396
So if we move our shoulders upward,

516
00:26:46,421 --> 00:26:48,576
the collarbone comes along with it,

517
00:26:49,398 --> 00:26:51,749
and the scapula as well.

518
00:26:52,124 --> 00:26:54,091
So, it's especially good to study

519
00:26:54,116 --> 00:26:55,740
the three bones that make up the shoulder

520
00:26:55,765 --> 00:26:58,877
that can move together.

521
00:27:01,695 --> 00:27:05,138
And the second thing is the pelvis.

522
00:27:05,163 --> 00:27:06,923
As I said,

523
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:09,494
the pelvis looks like a heart.

524
00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:11,080
But if it's too difficult,

525
00:27:11,081 --> 00:27:14,912
just think of a Frisbee folded in half.

526
00:27:14,937 --> 00:27:16,581
The more you simplify it,

527
00:27:16,606 --> 00:27:18,013
the less accurate it becomes.

528
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:20,570
That's why I don't simplify too much.

529
00:27:20,595 --> 00:27:22,140
So you have to remember that.

530
00:27:22,226 --> 00:27:26,547
And one of the important parts at this point is,

531
00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:29,077
that the leg bone goes out and then goes down.

532
00:27:31,632 --> 00:27:32,452
Like this.

533
00:27:32,632 --> 00:27:36,656
So there's a lot of space between the legs.

534
00:27:36,761 --> 00:27:39,117
Thus, there are people who express it

535
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:41,374
by attaching the area under their hips.

536
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:42,515
To prevent this,

537
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:46,076
there must certainly be a space between them.

538
00:27:46,101 --> 00:27:47,613
In other words, you need some spacing between the legs.

539
00:27:47,615 --> 00:27:50,393
So please remember,

540
00:27:50,395 --> 00:27:52,404
there must be some space between them.

541
00:27:52,429 --> 00:27:54,449
Besides these two parts,

542
00:27:54,451 --> 00:27:56,062
there's one more important thing.

543
00:27:56,195 --> 00:27:58,218
That is the neck.

544
00:27:58,913 --> 00:28:01,763
We'll look into it in detail when we do the facial part.

545
00:28:01,788 --> 00:28:04,204
While drawing casual characters,

546
00:28:04,206 --> 00:28:06,966
there were a lot of errors in the neck part

547
00:28:06,991 --> 00:28:08,484
when I was teaching students.

548
00:28:08,632 --> 00:28:11,023
So, how would you analyze the neck area?

549
00:28:11,124 --> 00:28:13,734
First, you need to know what the skull looks like.

550
00:28:14,999 --> 00:28:20,615
When we draw the head simply, the skull

551
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,101
looks like this.

552
00:28:23,484 --> 00:28:26,006
The back of the skull would be thick

553
00:28:26,008 --> 00:28:27,648
and quite long

554
00:28:27,673 --> 00:28:30,357
so much so that it looks like an alien's head.

555
00:28:30,382 --> 00:28:32,788
That's how a casual-style character's skull looks.

556
00:28:33,146 --> 00:28:35,343
So, if we look at the part where the neck is,

557
00:28:35,368 --> 00:28:36,859
where would our neck bone be attached to?

558
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:39,273
That goes at the back.

559
00:28:39,906 --> 00:28:42,031
But, a lot of people can't get this right.

560
00:28:42,226 --> 00:28:44,618
Because a casual-style character has a thin neck,

561
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,594
when people draw that,

562
00:28:45,596 --> 00:28:47,351
some people draw it like this.

563
00:28:47,804 --> 00:28:50,382
Then it becomes weird.

564
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:53,719
So, sticking the neck to the back of the head

565
00:28:53,866 --> 00:28:56,413
will always be very important.

566
00:28:58,507 --> 00:29:01,257
And the second most important thing is,

567
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:03,304
the sternocleidomastoid muscle.

568
00:29:04,757 --> 00:29:06,335
After that,

569
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,890
here's the trapezius muscle.

570
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:11,319
This is the part we massage when we're massaging our shoulders.

571
00:29:11,562 --> 00:29:13,209
So with these parts,

572
00:29:13,234 --> 00:29:15,609
and especially with the sternocleidomastoid muscle,

573
00:29:15,843 --> 00:29:19,359
is that it nearly goes to the back of the neck if we see the profile.

574
00:29:19,757 --> 00:29:21,278
In other words,

575
00:29:21,413 --> 00:29:23,316
when we're drawing a face that looks diagonally,

576
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:27,585
the ear would be here, and the sternocleidomastoid muscle

577
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:31,906
would come up to the collarbone from right behind the ears.

578
00:29:32,349 --> 00:29:33,921
If we have this part,

579
00:29:33,946 --> 00:29:35,529
this would be the back of the neck.

580
00:29:35,741 --> 00:29:38,601
But, a common mistake would be this.

581
00:29:39,499 --> 00:29:41,499
Let's say the upper body looks like this.

582
00:29:41,648 --> 00:29:43,601
Now, we have to connect the neck here,

583
00:29:43,875 --> 00:29:46,515
but, there are sometimes people who connect the neck here.

584
00:29:48,304 --> 00:29:50,234
This mistake sometimes occurs.

585
00:29:50,351 --> 00:29:51,490
But, if you do this,

586
00:29:51,492 --> 00:29:53,670
there will be no space for the sternocleidomastoid muscle.

587
00:29:53,695 --> 00:29:56,285
Also, in this case, the neck won't be connected to the back of the head.

588
00:29:56,287 --> 00:29:58,522
So, it will look quite unnatural.

589
00:29:58,524 --> 00:30:00,087
So, when you're attaching the neck

590
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,717
make sure it is connected to the back of the head

591
00:30:01,719 --> 00:30:04,068
and make sure there's enough room for the sternocleidomastoid muscle.

592
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:06,288
If you work with that in mind,

593
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:09,321
you will be able to draw it in detail.

594
00:30:11,234 --> 00:30:13,388
If these three things are difficult parts of the human body

595
00:30:13,413 --> 00:30:17,124
in terms of the line,

596
00:30:17,202 --> 00:30:21,476
let's take this opportunity to add additional details.

597
00:30:21,718 --> 00:30:24,991
And the additional parts are about the muscles.

598
00:30:25,132 --> 00:30:28,548
If we pinpoint the parts where the muscle lines are evident in a human body,

599
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:30,577
where would those parts be?

600
00:30:30,726 --> 00:30:32,602
Of course, it becomes different

601
00:30:32,604 --> 00:30:34,334
when it's a male character.

602
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:37,365
But it's not that late to study the muscle lines

603
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:39,427
of the body parts later.

604
00:30:39,452 --> 00:30:41,835
Like I said before,

605
00:30:41,837 --> 00:30:44,773
you can cover these parts with clothes.

606
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,906
So, guess the important part here.

607
00:30:47,218 --> 00:30:49,740
I think it's the limbs.

608
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:51,240
You can't cover the limbs

609
00:30:51,265 --> 00:30:53,429
with clothes.

610
00:30:53,796 --> 00:30:56,140
Therefore, let's go over this part now.

611
00:30:57,429 --> 00:30:59,310
There are many kinds of muscles in the arm.

612
00:30:59,335 --> 00:31:01,913
So if we divide it in detail,

613
00:31:08,406 --> 00:31:11,476
starting from the biceps that stick to the front of the arm,

614
00:31:11,501 --> 00:31:13,538
the triceps on the back of the arm,

615
00:31:14,171 --> 00:31:18,335
and on the bottom of the elbow, there's a muscle too.

616
00:31:18,749 --> 00:31:20,969
Let's talk about this in a simpler way.

617
00:31:21,249 --> 00:31:23,218
Let's say this arm is stretched like this,

618
00:31:23,421 --> 00:31:26,163
The overall flow of the arm line is

619
00:31:30,132 --> 00:31:31,427
the inner line.

620
00:31:31,452 --> 00:31:32,847
It's the inner line of the arm.

621
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,913
Let's say there's a palm here.

622
00:31:41,511 --> 00:31:43,312
If you look at the inner line,

623
00:31:44,124 --> 00:31:48,116
I think it's a line that sticks out gently.

624
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:52,202
This triceps area behind the other arm comes out

625
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:56,257
with a line that pops out quickly and then pokes in.

626
00:31:57,523 --> 00:32:00,404
The triceps are shorter than the biceps,

627
00:32:00,429 --> 00:32:02,234
so the line breaks like this.

628
00:32:03,241 --> 00:32:04,945
And then the elbow pops out.

629
00:32:05,374 --> 00:32:07,482
On the other hand, if you look at the bottom of the arm,

630
00:32:07,507 --> 00:32:10,812
the inside has a line that sticks out and goes in.

631
00:32:11,156 --> 00:32:13,882
The outer part has a line that sticks out.

632
00:32:14,327 --> 00:32:16,262
Some people draw it backwards sometimes.

633
00:32:16,264 --> 00:32:17,823
You have to be careful not to do that.

634
00:32:17,825 --> 00:32:19,273
So do you remember the patterns?

635
00:32:19,298 --> 00:32:22,929
The inner part is gentle, then it sticks out and goes in

636
00:32:23,663 --> 00:32:27,015
and the outer part came out, went in, and became more gentle.

637
00:32:27,507 --> 00:32:31,268
Let's remember this line and apply it when you draw the arm.

638
00:32:31,546 --> 00:32:35,771
Of course, it changes slightly depending on the posture of the arm.

639
00:32:35,796 --> 00:32:38,443
For example, if you fold the arms inwards,

640
00:32:38,468 --> 00:32:43,202
the biceps contract.

641
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:45,546
They might stick out more than the muscles in the back.

642
00:32:45,687 --> 00:32:48,429
Just remember that generally,

643
00:32:48,454 --> 00:32:50,616
it looks like this.

644
00:32:50,921 --> 00:32:53,787
Leg muscles are the opposite of this.

645
00:32:53,812 --> 00:32:55,046
What does that mean?

646
00:32:55,187 --> 00:32:59,089
Inside the thigh, there's the adductor muscle

647
00:32:59,091 --> 00:33:00,287
and that muscle

648
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:03,296
goes up to two-thirds length of the thigh.

649
00:33:03,999 --> 00:33:06,937
It goes up to two-thirds of the thigh.

650
00:33:08,351 --> 00:33:09,296
Because of that,

651
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:13,710
the inner curves of the legs curve out, then in.

652
00:33:15,171 --> 00:33:18,234
The outside curve isn't as curved.

653
00:33:20,108 --> 00:33:22,195
From the knee,

654
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,468
the inner curve bulges out

655
00:33:27,062 --> 00:33:29,041
and goes in again.

656
00:33:29,043 --> 00:33:32,506
Likewise, the outer curve only bulges out slightly.

657
00:33:32,702 --> 00:33:36,716
So, unlike the arm curves,

658
00:33:36,717 --> 00:33:38,952
the leg curves tend to have a recurring pattern.

659
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,624
Let's study some more about the legs.

660
00:33:42,649 --> 00:33:44,201
If we look at the kneecap,

661
00:33:44,226 --> 00:33:46,726
there would be the thighbone at the upper part of the leg.

662
00:33:46,843 --> 00:33:49,187
Right here.

663
00:33:49,296 --> 00:33:52,273
And if we say there's a fibula here,

664
00:33:52,298 --> 00:33:54,656
we can say

665
00:33:54,681 --> 00:33:55,882
that there's a circle in between here.

666
00:33:56,171 --> 00:33:59,601
This part would be the joint.

667
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:04,210
Within the joint, there would be the leg muscle,

668
00:34:04,538 --> 00:34:05,820
and the ligaments.

669
00:34:05,874 --> 00:34:08,624
These things would cover the bones.

670
00:34:08,804 --> 00:34:12,343
Now, the inner muscles would start

671
00:34:14,064 --> 00:34:17,187
from the fibula here.

672
00:34:19,202 --> 00:34:20,851
On the other hand, with this outer part,

673
00:34:21,303 --> 00:34:22,437
if we say the center

674
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:25,959
starts from below here,

675
00:34:25,984 --> 00:34:29,202
the outer part starts from the center.

676
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:32,077
But, it doesn't mean this is exact.

677
00:34:32,102 --> 00:34:33,413
I'm dividing this because

678
00:34:33,601 --> 00:34:36,271
the outer muscle begins to curve earlier

679
00:34:36,296 --> 00:34:38,435
compared to the inner muscle.

680
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,921
The part that curves out the most for each side

681
00:34:40,968 --> 00:34:41,781
would be these two areas.

682
00:34:41,806 --> 00:34:44,109
See how they have different curve rates?

683
00:34:44,351 --> 00:34:45,468
If you're aware of this,

684
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:47,718
you can draw natural legs.

685
00:34:50,499 --> 00:34:51,538
And one more thing.

686
00:34:51,563 --> 00:34:52,891
The reason

687
00:34:53,031 --> 00:34:55,112
we need to learn more things for the legs compared to the arms

688
00:34:55,114 --> 00:34:56,636
is just because they're more difficult to draw.

689
00:34:57,788 --> 00:34:59,532
Overall, the leg kind of looks like

690
00:34:59,534 --> 00:35:01,187
a bolt of lightning.

691
00:35:02,241 --> 00:35:05,616
It goes inwards, then outwards

692
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,077
then inwards again.

693
00:35:10,224 --> 00:35:11,810
It looks weird if you think about it.

694
00:35:11,835 --> 00:35:12,937
But actually,

695
00:35:12,939 --> 00:35:15,499
it may not be so weird.

696
00:35:15,663 --> 00:35:17,046
So what do I mean?

697
00:35:19,593 --> 00:35:20,801
When it's drawn like this,

698
00:35:20,803 --> 00:35:22,420
let's look for the bones of the legs.

699
00:35:22,422 --> 00:35:23,693
The leg bone before

700
00:35:23,718 --> 00:35:25,788
was sticking out and going back in.

701
00:35:27,413 --> 00:35:29,339
The bone that comes out from the kneecap

702
00:35:29,341 --> 00:35:31,148
would be the thighbone.

703
00:35:32,796 --> 00:35:34,765
Here, you would draw the tibia and fibula.

704
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:37,210
Let's think about the protruding part of our tibia.

705
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:40,132
When you touch it, you may be able to find the hard bones

706
00:35:40,157 --> 00:35:42,921
and you can call it the fibula.

707
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:45,476
If you draw along the fibula, it looks like this.

708
00:35:46,249 --> 00:35:49,302
I previously taught you that the leg looks like lightning.

709
00:35:49,327 --> 00:35:51,048
But if you see the line of this bone,

710
00:35:51,049 --> 00:35:52,584
it looks more like a straight line.

711
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:55,952
When your legs look like lightning,

712
00:35:55,977 --> 00:35:57,796
the legs will stand straight.

713
00:35:58,093 --> 00:36:00,616
This is one of the parts where people make the most mistakes.

714
00:36:01,898 --> 00:36:04,295
Some people don't draw the lightning properly.

715
00:36:04,297 --> 00:36:06,189
Errors occur more often

716
00:36:06,191 --> 00:36:07,718
when you draw the side leg line.

717
00:36:08,812 --> 00:36:12,265
The side legs tend to be tilted backward.

718
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:14,138
If it's straightened out,

719
00:36:14,163 --> 00:36:17,343
the line comes out like this.

720
00:36:17,515 --> 00:36:21,707
If we apply what we've learned,

721
00:36:21,709 --> 00:36:24,663
the tibia would stick out forwards.

722
00:36:24,688 --> 00:36:26,663
The tibia and the fibula go forwards.

723
00:36:27,913 --> 00:36:30,101
If we touch the front of our shin, it's stiff

724
00:36:30,531 --> 00:36:31,632
because the bones are right underneath it.

725
00:36:31,657 --> 00:36:33,177
So it'll look like this.

726
00:36:33,179 --> 00:36:35,695
If you look at it, the leg bones are almost straight like this.

727
00:36:36,296 --> 00:36:38,998
But when we need to make the legs straight,

728
00:36:39,023 --> 00:36:41,835
some people draw like this.

729
00:36:45,531 --> 00:36:46,304
Just like this.

730
00:36:47,484 --> 00:36:50,014
So they're not straight legs

731
00:36:50,016 --> 00:36:51,277
but folded ones.

732
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:55,382
So, to not make this mistake,

733
00:36:55,384 --> 00:36:57,031
overall, with this leg,

734
00:36:58,077 --> 00:37:00,420
I call it the side curve.

735
00:37:00,445 --> 00:37:02,762
You should take note of

736
00:37:02,764 --> 00:37:04,408
this curve that goes a bit backward.

737
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:07,452
People make a lot of mistakes here,

738
00:37:07,477 --> 00:37:08,842
with how they would draw the outlines.

739
00:37:09,062 --> 00:37:11,482
So, we briefly went over

740
00:37:11,507 --> 00:37:14,077
the proportions.

741
00:37:14,452 --> 00:37:18,054
We also learned about the curves and outlines

742
00:37:18,132 --> 00:37:19,366
where a lot of students make mistakes.

743
00:37:19,663 --> 00:37:20,991
By utilizing these things,

744
00:37:21,016 --> 00:37:23,991
now you need to make a mannequin.

745
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:26,413
So the ratios on the left,

746
00:37:26,593 --> 00:37:27,810
try to remember them

747
00:37:27,835 --> 00:37:29,459
and find the ratio

748
00:37:29,484 --> 00:37:33,257
that you like.

749
00:37:34,163 --> 00:37:35,757
When you work on the illustration,

750
00:37:35,898 --> 00:37:38,163
how could you make it your own?

751
00:37:38,188 --> 00:37:41,023
Now we will learn about the deformers.

752
00:37:41,304 --> 00:37:42,436
Also,

753
00:37:46,187 --> 00:37:47,718
you may call it deform.

754
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,460
Deform,

755
00:37:48,485 --> 00:37:49,249
or deformers

756
00:37:49,274 --> 00:37:51,865
refer to

757
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:57,831
when we distort, emphasize, or omit certain elements

758
00:37:57,833 --> 00:37:59,109
of an object.

759
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:02,281
For example, you can make a character's head bigger to emphasize it.

760
00:38:02,749 --> 00:38:06,843
Or, you might decide to not draw certain curves of a character.

761
00:38:06,937 --> 00:38:09,796
These parts with distortions

762
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:11,959
and changes

763
00:38:11,984 --> 00:38:13,288
are called deformers.

764
00:38:13,484 --> 00:38:17,140
There's no right answer to deformers.

765
00:38:17,241 --> 00:38:20,553
From the moment we decided to draw a casual-style character,

766
00:38:20,555 --> 00:38:22,929
we've already decided to draw a body with incorrect proportions.

767
00:38:23,132 --> 00:38:25,670
How many people in real life would have a head that big?

768
00:38:25,695 --> 00:38:28,116
Deformers could be applied differently depending on the artist

769
00:38:28,141 --> 00:38:30,429
and the situation.

770
00:38:30,562 --> 00:38:32,359
Today, I want to tell you this.

771
00:38:32,765 --> 00:38:33,882
Depending on the circumstance...

772
00:38:37,085 --> 00:38:38,357
Why do things change

773
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:41,084
depending on the circumstance?

774
00:38:41,109 --> 00:38:42,183
Why does it happen?

775
00:38:42,468 --> 00:38:44,066
When we choose our illustration...

776
00:38:44,067 --> 00:38:46,670
we will get to see a variety of illustrations.

777
00:38:46,672 --> 00:38:48,288
The full body shot,

778
00:38:48,313 --> 00:38:49,960
or the waist shot

779
00:38:50,109 --> 00:38:51,943
or the illustration with an eye-catching face,

780
00:38:51,968 --> 00:38:53,937
or the illustration with an eye-catching mood,

781
00:38:54,038 --> 00:38:55,616
and so on.

782
00:38:55,749 --> 00:38:58,597
Depending on that,

783
00:38:58,599 --> 00:38:59,640
the thing that changes a lot is the deformers.

784
00:38:59,827 --> 00:39:03,140
When you're comparing

785
00:39:04,563 --> 00:39:06,976
a waist shot with the head emphasized

786
00:39:10,883 --> 00:39:12,765
to a full body shot,

787
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,396
which image

788
00:39:15,421 --> 00:39:17,812
would have a proportionally larger head?

789
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:21,523
Of course, it might differ depending on the image,

790
00:39:21,624 --> 00:39:25,538
but, usually, a full body shot

791
00:39:27,925 --> 00:39:29,382
would have a larger head.

792
00:39:30,202 --> 00:39:31,515
But why?

793
00:39:32,085 --> 00:39:34,685
With the waist shot image, where the head is emphasized,

794
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,504
if the head is too big,

795
00:39:36,506 --> 00:39:38,445
you might feel that something's not right.

796
00:39:39,202 --> 00:39:41,429
This feeling is usually called

797
00:39:41,454 --> 00:39:42,752
the uncanny valley.

798
00:39:48,156 --> 00:39:49,324
So, what is this uncanny valley?

799
00:39:49,609 --> 00:39:56,584
As your drawing style becomes more realistic,

800
00:39:56,609 --> 00:40:00,380
people tend to like your characters more.

801
00:40:00,919 --> 00:40:02,911
But, before the intimacy level hits max,

802
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,966
there is an area where the intimacy level dips down.

803
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:08,091
This area would be the uncanny valley.

804
00:40:08,419 --> 00:40:11,755
Of course, most people would like realistic characters

805
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,925
because they would look pretty and nice.

806
00:40:12,927 --> 00:40:14,386
But, if you draw too realistically,

807
00:40:14,411 --> 00:40:17,130
for example, if you draw veins

808
00:40:17,309 --> 00:40:20,784
or pimples,

809
00:40:20,809 --> 00:40:23,614
your audience might not find the characters too appealing.

810
00:40:24,067 --> 00:40:27,731
This would be the uncanny valley.

811
00:40:27,733 --> 00:40:29,966
And, this would also be a type of an uncanny valley.

812
00:40:30,278 --> 00:40:32,067
The character already has a big head.

813
00:40:32,184 --> 00:40:33,167
It looks even bigger

814
00:40:33,192 --> 00:40:35,903
on the waist shot.

815
00:40:35,928 --> 00:40:38,277
So the face is already eye-catching.

816
00:40:38,614 --> 00:40:40,684
It stands out

817
00:40:40,788 --> 00:40:42,005
because of the large face.

818
00:40:42,341 --> 00:40:43,691
Although we applied the same ratio,

819
00:40:43,716 --> 00:40:45,714
like as usual,

820
00:40:45,739 --> 00:40:48,817
the head of the character stands out too much.

821
00:40:49,231 --> 00:40:51,627
So when I draw a waist shot,

822
00:40:51,629 --> 00:40:54,333
I often make the face smaller than usual.

823
00:40:55,512 --> 00:40:57,667
On the other hand, in the case of a full body shot,

824
00:40:57,692 --> 00:41:00,339
what's the most important part when we draw characters?

825
00:41:00,341 --> 00:41:01,755
It's the facial part.

826
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:03,487
But you can't see the face.

827
00:41:03,723 --> 00:41:05,435
Because you have to see the full body shot,

828
00:41:05,676 --> 00:41:07,218
the face doesn't stand out.

829
00:41:07,411 --> 00:41:10,489
Then, in this case,

830
00:41:10,572 --> 00:41:12,446
change the method,

831
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:14,816
by drawing the face larger to help people to see it.

832
00:41:14,841 --> 00:41:16,450
This was the first circumstance.

833
00:41:16,583 --> 00:41:17,958
Then what else do we have?

834
00:41:18,106 --> 00:41:20,841
When you draw a mature character,

835
00:41:21,098 --> 00:41:23,083
you can make the face smaller.

836
00:41:23,085 --> 00:41:25,387
Or reduce the size of the eyes.

837
00:41:25,762 --> 00:41:28,028
So it can change like that.

838
00:41:29,372 --> 00:41:32,267
If you're drawing a cute character, make the face bigger

839
00:41:32,269 --> 00:41:34,153
or make the proportions shorter.

840
00:41:34,178 --> 00:41:35,698
You can change it like that.

841
00:41:35,723 --> 00:41:38,747
Deformers can also be different depending on the shape of the clothes

842
00:41:38,958 --> 00:41:40,040
For instance,

843
00:41:40,042 --> 00:41:42,325
clothes with a thick neck part like this

844
00:41:44,028 --> 00:41:46,536
are often put on casual-style characters.

845
00:41:46,575 --> 00:41:49,864
With this clothing, if you draw the neck with the correct proportion,

846
00:41:50,981 --> 00:41:53,761
like how I'm doing here,

847
00:41:53,786 --> 00:41:57,106
because the shoulders would then be around here,

848
00:41:58,403 --> 00:41:59,985
there's not much. Just empty space.

849
00:41:59,987 --> 00:42:02,198
So, if I erase this part,

850
00:42:02,223 --> 00:42:03,809
the neck would look very short.

851
00:42:04,325 --> 00:42:06,385
So, when you're drawing clothing that looks like this,

852
00:42:06,387 --> 00:42:08,114
we make the neck longer.

853
00:42:08,598 --> 00:42:11,919
The neck would be this long.

854
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:14,778
Then, even if the neck is really long like this,

855
00:42:15,419 --> 00:42:18,341
on the outside, it will look natural.

856
00:42:18,481 --> 00:42:20,151
Let me share another example.

857
00:42:20,176 --> 00:42:22,223
This is a common sleeve

858
00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:25,450
when we're designing a character's sleeve these days.

859
00:42:25,452 --> 00:42:26,730
Like this.

860
00:42:28,497 --> 00:42:30,473
If you draw a wide line like this,

861
00:42:30,498 --> 00:42:31,874
just like with the neck we drew,

862
00:42:31,875 --> 00:42:35,012
the arms may be a bit short.

863
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:37,723
So, if we make sure the arm's proportions are correct

864
00:42:38,575 --> 00:42:41,455
and put in the arms up to this part,

865
00:42:41,457 --> 00:42:43,022
the arm itself would look

866
00:42:43,024 --> 00:42:44,216
very short.

867
00:42:44,387 --> 00:42:46,361
So, when this happens, we intentionally

868
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:47,692
make the arm a bit longer.

869
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:56,301
Let me show you another example

870
00:42:57,411 --> 00:42:58,919
with a cloth that covers the upper body, right here.

871
00:42:59,497 --> 00:43:03,403
Let's say we have a cloth like this.

872
00:43:10,158 --> 00:43:11,799
If we go along with this outline,

873
00:43:11,824 --> 00:43:13,243
our eyes would look at the belly,

874
00:43:13,268 --> 00:43:15,563
then they would look outwards, then inwards again.

875
00:43:15,588 --> 00:43:17,265
So, if we're not careful,

876
00:43:17,267 --> 00:43:20,150
this area could look very fat.

877
00:43:20,283 --> 00:43:22,822
So, when you're drawing this kind of clothing,

878
00:43:23,494 --> 00:43:26,229
try to make these outlines go more inwards.

879
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:27,986
The waist should be thin

880
00:43:28,408 --> 00:43:29,680
so that our eyesight would move naturally

881
00:43:29,705 --> 00:43:31,322
and the body would look more beautiful.

882
00:43:31,885 --> 00:43:34,893
So, in conclusion, deformers change a lot

883
00:43:34,918 --> 00:43:37,346
depending on the shape of the clothes.

884
00:43:38,244 --> 00:43:40,749
What I want to tell you

885
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,361
is that

886
00:43:42,408 --> 00:43:44,260
deformers don't follow a set rule.

887
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:48,893
So you might say we had a proportion class earlier but

888
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:50,182
what does this mean?

889
00:43:50,207 --> 00:43:52,857
The main reason I set the proportion is

890
00:43:52,869 --> 00:43:53,997
to make sure it's easier to

891
00:43:54,108 --> 00:43:55,627
create a mannequin

892
00:43:55,652 --> 00:43:57,619
that's easily movable in my head.

893
00:43:57,783 --> 00:43:59,994
The ratio is different every single time you draw,

894
00:44:00,019 --> 00:44:01,548
depending on the character's setting,

895
00:44:01,549 --> 00:44:02,525
the age, the use of the illustration,

896
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:04,033
and the composition of the illustration.

897
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:06,695
It keeps changing.

898
00:44:06,711 --> 00:44:09,813
So keep the proportions organized like this,

899
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:11,479
but don't be tied down.

900
00:44:12,002 --> 00:44:13,868
So that would be the biggest takeaway

901
00:44:13,893 --> 00:44:16,838
of this lecture today.

902
00:44:17,486 --> 00:44:19,930
I'm sure a lot of people are studying with a fixed proportion.

903
00:44:19,955 --> 00:44:21,367
Or some may set the proportion

904
00:44:21,369 --> 00:44:23,111
after this lecture.

905
00:44:23,166 --> 00:44:25,119
But when you have the proportion fixed,

906
00:44:25,144 --> 00:44:26,830
you have to be flexible with it,

907
00:44:26,855 --> 00:44:28,799
depending on the use of the illustration,

908
00:44:28,801 --> 00:44:30,696
and to use deformers effectively.

909
00:44:30,721 --> 00:44:32,775
And you can call it an effective ratio.

910
00:44:32,955 --> 00:44:35,252
So please remember this part.

911
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:39,307
To summarize the theoretical content up to here,

912
00:44:39,332 --> 00:44:42,588
we went through the proportions of the human body.

913
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:45,399
And what's important in the ratio of the human body.

914
00:44:45,424 --> 00:44:48,408
Making a mannequin that can move in your head.

915
00:44:48,518 --> 00:44:53,299
The more accurately, freely, and quickly you can move this mannequin,

916
00:44:53,324 --> 00:44:56,518
the more your drawing skills will improve.

917
00:44:57,135 --> 00:45:00,430
Therefore, if you divide the human body into three elements,

918
00:45:00,455 --> 00:45:04,244
those would be the movement, ratio,

919
00:45:04,455 --> 00:45:06,240
and line.

920
00:45:06,241 --> 00:45:07,343
But among those,

921
00:45:07,345 --> 00:45:10,158
we went through the ratio and the line parts.

922
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:13,830
I recommend you to look at the proportions that I mentioned before,

923
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,541
and with these fixed ratios,

924
00:45:16,566 --> 00:45:17,633
focus on the curves that you can't depict properly,

925
00:45:17,634 --> 00:45:19,243
for example, the shoulders, the neck, the pelvis, and the legs.

926
00:45:19,268 --> 00:45:23,596
Focus on these parts, and then study more.

927
00:45:24,846 --> 00:45:29,299
Once you're done with the proportions,

928
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:33,047
apply some deformers that go well with your situation.

929
00:45:33,072 --> 00:45:36,486
That was a summary of what we learned today.

930
00:45:38,408 --> 00:45:41,307
So, now I'll tell you

931
00:45:41,416 --> 00:45:43,400
how you should practice from now on.

932
00:45:43,432 --> 00:45:45,994
Now, with the

933
00:45:47,149 --> 00:45:48,275
actual drawing part,

934
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:53,604
like I mentioned before,

935
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:56,482
this lecture is more about

936
00:45:56,495 --> 00:46:00,176
practicing on your own.

937
00:46:00,178 --> 00:46:02,096
So, I'll tell you how to do this briefly.

938
00:46:02,213 --> 00:46:06,047
Whenever you're drawing a human body, it takes a long time

939
00:46:06,072 --> 00:46:09,133
to draw every part of it.

940
00:46:09,158 --> 00:46:11,275
If it takes a long time,

941
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:14,010
it's hard to find time to practice,

942
00:46:15,544 --> 00:46:17,268
and you won't be able to draw a lot.

943
00:46:19,057 --> 00:46:21,266
You'll spend a lot of time fixing one thing.

944
00:46:21,291 --> 00:46:23,846
So, remember when I told you

945
00:46:23,986 --> 00:46:26,660
that the torso is important?

946
00:46:26,662 --> 00:46:28,103
Well, now let's get into it.

947
00:46:28,166 --> 00:46:31,158
We're going to practice the human body part by part.

948
00:46:31,299 --> 00:46:32,439
The first practice method

949
00:46:32,464 --> 00:46:33,744
is to practice part by part.

950
00:46:39,191 --> 00:46:41,493
So what it means is,

951
00:46:41,518 --> 00:46:44,419
just focus on a single part at one time.

952
00:46:46,627 --> 00:46:49,211
We will go over movement in the next lecture.

953
00:46:49,236 --> 00:46:51,775
When you learn about movement,

954
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,814
you'll have to practice that a lot.

955
00:46:55,536 --> 00:46:57,400
Because we need to draw while applying poses.

956
00:46:59,709 --> 00:47:02,221
But, even when you don't have a set pose,

957
00:47:04,695 --> 00:47:06,752
you can just draw the same torso

958
00:47:09,377 --> 00:47:11,229
in different angles

959
00:47:11,898 --> 00:47:14,689
repetitively, like this.

960
00:47:19,976 --> 00:47:22,275
Second, you turn it around.

961
00:47:29,487 --> 00:47:31,625
If you practiced with the torso,

962
00:47:34,277 --> 00:47:43,546
practice the arms

963
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:46,601
and raise them up and down.

964
00:47:51,688 --> 00:47:53,312
Raise them diagonally, too.

965
00:48:01,164 --> 00:48:02,842
When you're focusing on a certain subject,

966
00:48:02,844 --> 00:48:05,703
focus on your weaknesses and analyze that.

967
00:48:06,002 --> 00:48:08,148
You could draw the leg like this.

968
00:48:13,492 --> 00:48:17,294
Otherwise, you could

969
00:48:23,661 --> 00:48:25,442
focus on the pelvis.

970
00:48:33,997 --> 00:48:36,817
Focus first on your weaknesses,

971
00:48:36,842 --> 00:48:41,212
then, draw a full human body.

972
00:48:44,411 --> 00:48:46,567
We're practicing them separately because

973
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,263
if you practice it part by part,

974
00:48:49,288 --> 00:48:50,686
the amount you can draw increases

975
00:48:50,688 --> 00:48:52,191
so it's more efficient.

976
00:48:52,216 --> 00:48:55,354
But you need to put them back together later.

977
00:48:55,379 --> 00:48:58,141
The ratios can get a bit awkward while doing that

978
00:48:58,166 --> 00:49:02,395
so make sure the things you learned in the ratio part

979
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:04,364
are all applied properly.

980
00:49:04,669 --> 00:49:07,888
And you could count that as a kind of practice.

981
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:12,599
Identify your weaknesses

982
00:49:12,624 --> 00:49:15,596
and practice those parts intensively.

983
00:49:15,621 --> 00:49:16,659
Keep practicing.

984
00:49:16,684 --> 00:49:19,347
Then, when you're done with those, turn them around,

985
00:49:19,349 --> 00:49:21,323
and make sure you can perceive them three-dimensionally.

986
00:49:21,463 --> 00:49:23,002
And, when you combine all of them,

987
00:49:23,027 --> 00:49:25,284
you'd be able to draw a mannequin.

988
00:49:25,721 --> 00:49:27,696
If you can draw a mannequin,

989
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:28,901
you can say the training was a success.

990
00:49:29,901 --> 00:49:31,360
It's like playing a rhythm game.

991
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:32,635
If you play rhythm games,

992
00:49:33,505 --> 00:49:36,442
you'll see there are a lot of similarities to this training exercise.

993
00:49:36,487 --> 00:49:37,824
If you play rhythm games,

994
00:49:37,826 --> 00:49:40,079
there's always an area where you make a lot of mistakes.

995
00:49:40,104 --> 00:49:42,345
But, if you keep playing the game from start to finish,

996
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:43,767
you'll always make the same mistakes.

997
00:49:43,792 --> 00:49:45,722
If you continue like that,

998
00:49:45,724 --> 00:49:47,956
it will take you a lot of time to strengthen your weaknesses.

999
00:49:48,284 --> 00:49:50,069
So, the best way to practice is

1000
00:49:50,071 --> 00:49:52,596
just by focusing on your weaknesses.

1001
00:49:53,065 --> 00:49:54,860
If you study only those parts,

1002
00:49:54,885 --> 00:49:57,206
you'll be able to get a perfect score in the game

1003
00:49:57,231 --> 00:49:59,439
a bit more quickly.

1004
00:50:01,355 --> 00:50:03,807
Of course, you would have to focus on other parts later on, too.

1005
00:50:05,682 --> 00:50:07,769
Drawing is a lot similar to that.

1006
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:10,127
Focus on your weaknesses

1007
00:50:10,152 --> 00:50:13,024
and intensively study to improve them.

1008
00:50:13,049 --> 00:50:14,399
So when I practice something,

1009
00:50:14,424 --> 00:50:17,235
what I think is most important is to set a goal.

1010
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:18,542
Therefore,

1011
00:50:18,567 --> 00:50:21,040
when you decide to focus on a certain subject,

1012
00:50:21,065 --> 00:50:23,221
you would focus by practicing that subject.

1013
00:50:23,246 --> 00:50:25,026
For instance, you might decide to focus on practicing shoulders one day

1014
00:50:25,292 --> 00:50:27,798
and focus on the pelvis the next day.

1015
00:50:27,823 --> 00:50:29,478
You might think of yourself as a gym trainee.

1016
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:32,313
Because you focus on certain parts,

1017
00:50:32,315 --> 00:50:33,487
I'm sure your training

1018
00:50:33,512 --> 00:50:35,799
will be much more effective.

1019
00:50:36,354 --> 00:50:39,352
Use this to practice drawing the human body.

1020
00:50:39,377 --> 00:50:41,292
Let me show you an example.

1021
00:50:51,952 --> 00:50:54,202
Some of you may have seen it before,

1022
00:50:55,561 --> 00:50:58,139
but we focus on certain areas like this.

1023
00:50:58,694 --> 00:51:00,983
See how I practiced the torsos?

1024
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,584
This is how you focus on a certain subject.

1025
00:51:05,295 --> 00:51:07,123
When you're done with that,

1026
00:51:09,605 --> 00:51:10,412
turn a body

1027
00:51:10,967 --> 00:51:13,747
around in different angles like this.

1028
00:51:13,772 --> 00:51:16,622
The most important thing is to maintain the same proportions.

1029
00:51:16,647 --> 00:51:18,600
There's some detailed information on the outline here,

1030
00:51:18,625 --> 00:51:19,911
but, this isn't that necessary.

1031
00:51:19,936 --> 00:51:22,436
You can draw it like a mannequin.

1032
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:23,919
But instead,

1033
00:51:23,944 --> 00:51:26,420
it is important to maintain the same proportion.

1034
00:51:26,795 --> 00:51:28,261
So keep the same proportion.

1035
00:51:28,263 --> 00:51:30,803
And you can try to put the limbs at a different angle.

1036
00:51:30,902 --> 00:51:33,905
When I see this, I call it art training.

1037
00:51:35,469 --> 00:51:37,209
So practice it,

1038
00:51:37,405 --> 00:51:39,803
by applying the limbs at a different angle.

1039
00:51:39,952 --> 00:51:41,850
It may look a bit difficult.

1040
00:51:41,852 --> 00:51:43,461
But as I said before,

1041
00:51:43,462 --> 00:51:45,506
you can ignore the line part for now.

1042
00:51:45,608 --> 00:51:47,015
So for the simple body shape,

1043
00:51:47,017 --> 00:51:49,561
if you are a newbie,

1044
00:51:50,571 --> 00:51:53,811
stick to the basics we went through today.

1045
00:51:55,319 --> 00:51:57,522
We are going to study it in the next class.

1046
00:51:57,655 --> 00:51:59,889
With a simplified human body,

1047
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,082
work on it

1048
00:52:07,942 --> 00:52:09,144
like this.

1049
00:52:14,003 --> 00:52:15,355
Spin it at different angles.

1050
00:52:23,769 --> 00:52:25,315
And through this process,

1051
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:28,746
the goal of this class was

1052
00:52:29,738 --> 00:52:33,062
to compose the movement

1053
00:52:33,064 --> 00:52:34,738
of a human body in our head.

1054
00:52:35,801 --> 00:52:38,565
In the next class,

1055
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:40,871
we will learn how to move the mannequin.

1056
00:52:44,715 --> 00:52:47,843
So that's the end of this class.

1057
00:52:47,922 --> 00:52:49,671
Thank you for your attention.
