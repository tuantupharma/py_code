2
00:00:06,608 --> 00:00:07,526
Hello.

3
00:00:07,551 --> 00:00:09,172
Continuing on from last time,

4
00:00:09,174 --> 00:00:10,867
using the second illustration,

5
00:00:10,892 --> 00:00:12,992
we'll work on a fancy and aggressive illustration.

6
00:00:13,017 --> 00:00:14,829
Let's get started.

7
00:00:14,854 --> 00:00:17,036
Before that, let's do the color roughing.

8
00:00:17,061 --> 00:00:19,382
I'll show you parts that are good to pay attention to when coloring

9
00:00:19,407 --> 00:00:22,382
that I didn't show you with the full illustration.

10
00:00:22,407 --> 00:00:24,532
Let's talk about that.

11
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:25,812
Let's move on.

12
00:00:25,837 --> 00:00:28,329
I'm telling you this,

13
00:00:28,354 --> 00:00:29,885
but the theories that we use as a result are ones

14
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,501
that I've already shown you.

15
00:00:31,526 --> 00:00:33,954
You're going to use them over and over again.

16
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:36,145
There's another example here.

17
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,964
Let's move on to this one.

18
00:00:39,923 --> 00:00:42,141
Before we start,

19
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:44,224
what kind of light will I give it?

20
00:00:44,226 --> 00:00:46,199
It's important to think about that first.

21
00:00:46,224 --> 00:00:48,163
But as I said before,

22
00:00:48,188 --> 00:00:50,500
for portrait illustrations, the lighting method

23
00:00:50,525 --> 00:00:51,902
has many restrictions.

24
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:54,409
Today, I'm going to show you the frontal light.

25
00:00:54,434 --> 00:00:55,507
I'll use it.

26
00:00:55,532 --> 00:00:57,855
The coloring method is Hard Light, and Soft Light.

27
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,213
It depends on the type of light.

28
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:04,580
I'm going to add some Soft Light to this illustration.

29
00:01:04,605 --> 00:01:06,738
It gives a three-dimensional effect to the tentacles in the back.

30
00:01:06,763 --> 00:01:09,994
I don't think only using Hard Light is enough.

31
00:01:10,714 --> 00:01:12,442
If this section goes like this,

32
00:01:12,467 --> 00:01:14,885
you don't get the unique roundness of the tentacles.

33
00:01:14,998 --> 00:01:16,566
To make the tentacles look round,

34
00:01:16,591 --> 00:01:17,924
it needs to spread smoothly.

35
00:01:18,596 --> 00:01:21,369
It's going to have Soft Light to a certain extent.

36
00:01:21,394 --> 00:01:23,407
I'll increase the intensity of the light.

37
00:01:23,654 --> 00:01:26,044
I'll reduce the amount of shadow.

38
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:27,613
I'm going to do that.

39
00:01:30,367 --> 00:01:31,932
When you add light and shadow,

40
00:01:31,934 --> 00:01:34,004
there are people who use Normal Layers.

41
00:01:34,029 --> 00:01:36,473
I'm sure there are people who apply Multiply Layers.

42
00:01:36,498 --> 00:01:39,169
If it's so hard to color each part,

43
00:01:39,194 --> 00:01:41,834
if it's so hard to paint different colors for each part,

44
00:01:41,836 --> 00:01:44,160
apply the Multiply Layer first

45
00:01:44,161 --> 00:01:46,480
and edit the color later.

46
00:01:46,851 --> 00:01:49,563
I want the color that I want to be applied.

47
00:01:49,565 --> 00:01:52,529
I recommend that you apply the Normal Layer.

48
00:01:52,714 --> 00:01:55,385
I usually use the Normal Layer more.

49
00:01:55,386 --> 00:01:56,720
Even if it's annoying,

50
00:01:56,745 --> 00:01:59,638
if you want the color to be applied here and there,

51
00:01:59,663 --> 00:02:00,985
you should use the basic framework.

52
00:02:05,627 --> 00:02:08,712
The order of light and shadows is different for each person.

53
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:10,325
The way I recommend it is

54
00:02:10,327 --> 00:02:11,948
doing everything as a whole.

55
00:02:12,271 --> 00:02:14,533
You have to go through the most important factors first.

56
00:02:14,558 --> 00:02:16,018
First of all,

57
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,427
you should know the overall flow.

58
00:02:19,617 --> 00:02:21,556
That's what I'm focusing on.

59
00:02:21,581 --> 00:02:22,691
Let's get into it.

60
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,633
When I first applied light and shadow,

61
00:02:30,658 --> 00:02:35,458
if possible, turn off the pressure with Hard Brush.

62
00:02:35,483 --> 00:02:36,838
I recommend it.

63
00:02:37,873 --> 00:02:40,245
But while I was applying the light and shadows,

64
00:02:40,247 --> 00:02:42,824
if you're worried that it's hard to get the atmosphere right,

65
00:02:42,826 --> 00:02:43,545
to those people,

66
00:02:43,553 --> 00:02:45,549
I want to recommend this method.

67
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,545
We're going to set the overall mood in advance.

68
00:02:48,547 --> 00:02:51,810
I said I'm going to use Soft Light.

69
00:02:51,835 --> 00:02:53,218
I'm going to do that in advance.

70
00:02:54,572 --> 00:02:56,356
Let's find out about shadows.

71
00:02:56,668 --> 00:02:59,605
When we color it, we give some shadow.

72
00:02:59,607 --> 00:03:01,643
There's the Cast Shadow,

73
00:03:02,606 --> 00:03:03,787
the Form Shadow.

74
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,653
There are two types.

75
00:03:05,776 --> 00:03:08,355
If I add one more, it's Occlusion Shadow.

76
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,168
Among Cast Shadows and Form Shadows,

77
00:03:11,193 --> 00:03:14,403
usually, we work on Cast Shadows first.

78
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:16,733
If the contrast of the picture gets too big,

79
00:03:16,758 --> 00:03:19,533
I told you that I can block it with this.

80
00:03:19,897 --> 00:03:22,498
But today, I'm going to change that a little bit.

81
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,896
I'm going to apply Form Shadow first.

82
00:03:24,077 --> 00:03:26,147
If you do this, the pros and cons are clear.

83
00:03:26,265 --> 00:03:27,899
The disadvantage is

84
00:03:27,924 --> 00:03:30,216
if you make a mistake, the contrast could get bigger.

85
00:03:30,241 --> 00:03:31,304
The picture might look like it's burning.

86
00:03:31,306 --> 00:03:32,802
If you can't control it yourself well,

87
00:03:32,977 --> 00:03:35,353
the good thing is that the way you color it

88
00:03:35,378 --> 00:03:36,623
is pretty simplified.

89
00:03:38,589 --> 00:03:40,940
I said that I would give this Form Shadow first,

90
00:03:40,965 --> 00:03:43,472
but I'm just going to make sure the overall Form Shadow is there.

91
00:03:49,956 --> 00:03:51,323
Form Shadow

92
00:03:51,348 --> 00:03:53,465
doesn't go into everything.

93
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:56,929
The Form Shadow goes into the whole lump.

94
00:03:57,014 --> 00:03:58,501
When you shine it on this whole lump,

95
00:03:58,502 --> 00:03:59,880
the part that receives the most light,

96
00:03:59,882 --> 00:04:01,931
it's probably the middle part that sticks out.

97
00:04:02,248 --> 00:04:03,357
The parts that get less light

98
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:05,510
would be the tentacles in the back.

99
00:04:06,395 --> 00:04:08,681
So, I'm going to apply Form Shadow.

100
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,282
You have to make it big at once like this.

101
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,032
I'm going to use the Multiply Layer.

102
00:04:17,342 --> 00:04:19,227
I'm going to create the overall shadow first.

103
00:04:21,688 --> 00:04:23,322
If this isn't enough,

104
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:26,486
create another layer, and this time, with the Screen Layer,

105
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:28,739
even the lack of light

106
00:04:30,412 --> 00:04:33,162
in the middle, like this,

107
00:04:35,421 --> 00:04:36,687
create it.

108
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:39,423
If you go through this process first,

109
00:04:39,448 --> 00:04:42,339
it feels like the illustrations are tied together.

110
00:04:42,363 --> 00:04:43,531
Before, and after.

111
00:04:44,845 --> 00:04:47,014
It definitely feels like it's tied up.

112
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:48,784
So if you do this before you go in,

113
00:04:48,809 --> 00:04:51,115
it'll be easier to work on it afterward.

114
00:04:51,117 --> 00:04:54,247
It's hard to get the nuances when coloring.

115
00:04:54,272 --> 00:04:56,102
No matter how hard you try to get the light and shadow correct,

116
00:04:56,127 --> 00:04:59,351
if you think your drawing is too distracting,

117
00:04:59,376 --> 00:05:02,938
I recommend that you start your first work with this.

118
00:05:04,322 --> 00:05:07,031
If you do it, it's the same as before.

119
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:08,708
Let's continue to add the light and shadows.

120
00:05:14,612 --> 00:05:17,172
I'll give a bluish color to the light.

121
00:05:17,197 --> 00:05:20,644
The color of the shadow and the color of the background are blue.

122
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:21,995
The color of the shadow

123
00:05:21,995 --> 00:05:24,173
should be a bit bluish.

124
00:05:24,175 --> 00:05:25,165
Let's move on.

125
00:05:30,993 --> 00:05:32,829
Use the Lasso Tool

126
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:34,931
to do your work more quickly.

127
00:05:55,677 --> 00:05:57,568
There's no right answer for coloring.

128
00:05:57,593 --> 00:05:59,871
Just make sure you're comfortable with it.

129
00:05:59,896 --> 00:06:03,185
The important thing is that you follow the principles that are applied.

130
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:06,964
So, depending on your coloring method,

131
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:09,150
It's good to think about the pros and cons in advance.

132
00:06:09,175 --> 00:06:10,784
Always, no matter what,

133
00:06:10,809 --> 00:06:12,418
there's no method where there's only advantages.

134
00:06:12,435 --> 00:06:15,925
If there are advantages, there will be disadvantages.

135
00:06:16,027 --> 00:06:18,868
So, I'm going to show you how I'm coloring it.

136
00:06:18,893 --> 00:06:21,551
This is the advantage of the way you paint, and this is the disadvantage.

137
00:06:21,553 --> 00:06:25,191
I hope you decide that on your own before you go in.

138
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,863
Even if it doesn't come out well, even if you tried your best,

139
00:06:27,865 --> 00:06:29,545
force yourself to do it.

140
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:31,567
That way, when you draw later on,

141
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:33,763
the part that you need to focus more on

142
00:06:33,765 --> 00:06:35,305
that you designated as your weakness,

143
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,912
you can strengthen the advantages that you have.

144
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:42,718
In the end, it's the process of studying.

145
00:06:44,015 --> 00:06:47,549
Like this, I don't have to do things that aren't set.

146
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:50,296
I tend to force myself to get into it.

147
00:06:50,475 --> 00:06:52,781
What are the similar examples?

148
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:55,677
In literature class,

149
00:06:55,702 --> 00:06:59,447
you might have seen examples like,

150
00:06:59,894 --> 00:07:04,023
as soon as the character saw a purple flower and expressed her feelings,

151
00:07:05,743 --> 00:07:07,395
this character likes purple.

152
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,600
And purple is the color of death.

153
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,928
So this character will die soon.

154
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,051
There was something like this.

155
00:07:12,204 --> 00:07:15,390
When the writer was interviewed about it later on,

156
00:07:15,415 --> 00:07:16,554
he said it wasn't anything like that.

157
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:18,709
He said he just liked azalea flowers.

158
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:20,430
What's important here is,

159
00:07:20,455 --> 00:07:23,897
I'm not saying that the book was wrong in the first place.

160
00:07:23,922 --> 00:07:26,693
While analyzing it,

161
00:07:26,718 --> 00:07:29,231
that's how someone interpreted it.

162
00:07:29,914 --> 00:07:32,042
But you have to interpret and analyze it.

163
00:07:32,044 --> 00:07:33,734
And the process itself is studying

164
00:07:33,984 --> 00:07:37,093
When I draw later, I'll increase the accuracy.

165
00:07:38,765 --> 00:07:41,032
It applies to the drawing as it is.

166
00:07:41,871 --> 00:07:43,375
When analyzing the references,

167
00:07:43,484 --> 00:07:46,067
I think, that's why it's good.

168
00:07:46,092 --> 00:07:47,320
I think, that's why it's not good

169
00:07:47,345 --> 00:07:48,687
You can divide it up like that.

170
00:07:48,713 --> 00:07:51,283
I think it's good to create this kind of atmosphere.

171
00:07:51,308 --> 00:07:53,847
I'm going to keep clarifying those things and making them into words.

172
00:07:53,872 --> 00:07:55,205
To make it into a sentence.

173
00:07:56,295 --> 00:07:58,751
You keep increasing what you know.

174
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:01,589
It might not be right for now.

175
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:03,587
As you get older,

176
00:08:03,612 --> 00:08:05,073
or you just as you're drawing,

177
00:08:05,104 --> 00:08:07,721
those things can be flipped over and over again.

178
00:08:07,746 --> 00:08:08,767
It doesn't matter.

179
00:08:09,194 --> 00:08:11,911
Your drawing speed will be much faster that way.

180
00:08:12,597 --> 00:08:14,397
When it comes to expanding your skills,

181
00:08:14,422 --> 00:08:16,112
it comes out much faster.

182
00:08:16,114 --> 00:08:17,960
The parts that go in wrong,

183
00:08:17,985 --> 00:08:19,698
you can strengthen them later.

184
00:08:34,153 --> 00:08:36,652
Under the assumption that light will continue to come out from the center,

185
00:08:36,677 --> 00:08:37,982
I'll add some light and shadow.

186
00:08:56,584 --> 00:08:58,229
The shadow that I'm applying right now.

187
00:08:58,231 --> 00:09:01,781
Cast Shadow is the key point.

188
00:09:01,806 --> 00:09:03,812
Of course, Form Shadow goes in from time to time.

189
00:09:03,837 --> 00:09:05,771
Cast Shadow and...

190
00:09:05,772 --> 00:09:08,200
When people see important Form Shadows being put together,

191
00:09:08,225 --> 00:09:10,093
some call it a Core Shadow.

192
00:09:10,403 --> 00:09:12,411
It's not a specific name.

193
00:09:12,982 --> 00:09:15,890
It's the most important shadow in a simple illustration.

194
00:09:15,891 --> 00:09:17,394
It's okay to understand it like that.

195
00:09:18,545 --> 00:09:20,702
Even if it's a Form Shadow,

196
00:09:20,704 --> 00:09:23,184
focus on the parts that you think will look darker.

197
00:09:23,276 --> 00:09:24,906
I'll express it like this.

198
00:09:25,025 --> 00:09:27,289
Let's keep working on the dimensional effects.

199
00:09:30,274 --> 00:09:33,128
When we are working on a strong image,

200
00:09:33,153 --> 00:09:34,564
what's important?

201
00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:36,681
In fact, this powerful and colorful image,

202
00:09:36,706 --> 00:09:38,337
when working on portrait illustration,

203
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:41,090
it's one of the most popular editing methods.

204
00:09:42,877 --> 00:09:45,774
In order to stimulate people's desire to buy,

205
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:48,207
the illustration needs to be fancy.

206
00:09:48,393 --> 00:09:51,104
So, you need to know how to make it fancy.

207
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,339
To be straightforward,

208
00:09:54,517 --> 00:09:59,805
the silhouette needs to be evident

209
00:09:59,912 --> 00:10:01,507
and the silhouette itself

210
00:10:01,532 --> 00:10:03,563
should be dense.

211
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,397
Even now, with the amount of tentacles,

212
00:10:05,422 --> 00:10:07,779
you'll see that there's a lot.

213
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:09,760
The fact that there are many things placed like this,

214
00:10:09,762 --> 00:10:11,623
it's not just because I wanted to draw tentacles.

215
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,482
It's annoying for me to draw tentacles, too.

216
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,012
But the reason why I put a lot of these is,

217
00:10:16,037 --> 00:10:19,348
using the tentacles for the overall silhouette,

218
00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:21,835
it's important that it is splitting.

219
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,458
So, the silhouette that's been split a lot

220
00:10:24,483 --> 00:10:27,300
raises the quality of the drawing.

221
00:10:27,301 --> 00:10:28,003
Let's move on.

222
00:10:28,004 --> 00:10:32,105
Other than that, there's the silhouette itself.

223
00:10:32,185 --> 00:10:35,795
You can see that the end of the fog has been torn a little bit.

224
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,454
I'll make it more detailed.

225
00:10:37,455 --> 00:10:39,248
The size of the particles will get smaller.

226
00:10:39,344 --> 00:10:42,534
We learned how to make particles smaller, right?

227
00:10:42,535 --> 00:10:44,191
The smaller the particle size,

228
00:10:44,918 --> 00:10:47,256
the higher the quality looks.

229
00:10:47,415 --> 00:10:50,642
By continuing to use those alternately,

230
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:52,711
you can make your drawing more fancy.

231
00:10:52,798 --> 00:10:55,124
The strong feeling there is...

232
00:10:55,149 --> 00:10:57,603
it looks a little more obvious.

233
00:10:57,677 --> 00:10:58,872
That's the situation.

234
00:10:59,854 --> 00:11:03,021
When I was drawing a cute character,

235
00:11:03,046 --> 00:11:05,017
we talked about contrast.

236
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:07,067
When I'm doing something that has a calm vibe,

237
00:11:07,092 --> 00:11:08,918
it's better to give less contrast.

238
00:11:09,658 --> 00:11:11,728
When you want to give a strong impression,

239
00:11:11,757 --> 00:11:13,788
I think it's better to be more prepared.

240
00:11:14,381 --> 00:11:16,218
I'll continue to use those.

241
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:21,111
And let's continue to work on this.

242
00:11:21,528 --> 00:11:24,340
Whenever you work on the Cast Shadow

243
00:11:24,342 --> 00:11:25,966
be careful when you put it in.

244
00:11:25,991 --> 00:11:27,578
So that you don't forget anything.

245
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,530
I forget it often, too.

246
00:11:50,331 --> 00:11:52,406
I focused on the big shadows.

247
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,434
And I'll continue to make the overall composition.

248
00:11:55,404 --> 00:11:58,682
In this process, the drawing is almost complete.

249
00:11:59,353 --> 00:12:03,005
So the brush touch goes in later,

250
00:12:03,072 --> 00:12:05,890
but there are so many students

251
00:12:05,915 --> 00:12:07,075
who always focus on the description.

252
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,598
Once again,

253
00:12:08,623 --> 00:12:10,142
it's not the description that matters.

254
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:11,569
It's not about the description.

255
00:12:11,996 --> 00:12:15,930
As long as it's well-organized,

256
00:12:15,955 --> 00:12:18,669
and as long as you're prepared for that,

257
00:12:18,694 --> 00:12:20,657
from the perspective of the viewers,

258
00:12:20,682 --> 00:12:23,425
they will understand what you wanted to express.

259
00:12:24,413 --> 00:12:27,700
You'll be able to grasp the character's charm.

260
00:12:27,886 --> 00:12:30,501
And one of the charms of that

261
00:12:30,502 --> 00:12:31,510
would be the brush touch.

262
00:12:33,218 --> 00:12:35,729
It shows the artist's own touching up methods.

263
00:12:36,182 --> 00:12:37,544
Of course, it's important.

264
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:39,685
It's not that it's not important at all.

265
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,829
But you shouldn't be too obsessed with that.

266
00:12:42,404 --> 00:12:44,724
It's something that you can put in later.

267
00:12:45,063 --> 00:12:47,182
It doesn't change that it's an additional factor.

268
00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:53,651
Even if you don't put in touch,

269
00:12:53,652 --> 00:12:57,010
if you just focus on the shadow area,

270
00:12:57,035 --> 00:12:59,926
it can be used for actual illustrations.

271
00:13:01,371 --> 00:13:02,796
It's not that you can't use it.

272
00:13:03,475 --> 00:13:05,774
If you organize this neatly,

273
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:06,975
it could be used for in-game illustrations.

274
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,910
You'll be able to get that feeling.

275
00:13:11,678 --> 00:13:12,695
So,

276
00:13:12,697 --> 00:13:15,012
if you don't draw a lot,

277
00:13:15,013 --> 00:13:17,158
and if the touch becomes too dirty when you're coloring,

278
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,598
even if you can't do the coloring in high quality,

279
00:13:20,623 --> 00:13:22,542
if you do it like this,

280
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:25,616
you'll be able to get the feeling a bit more easily.

281
00:13:30,681 --> 00:13:33,133
If you succeed that much, you'll do it by experience later on.

282
00:13:33,158 --> 00:13:34,505
You'll continue to gain experience.

283
00:13:35,258 --> 00:13:37,124
Make sure to strengthen the brush touch.

284
00:13:39,246 --> 00:13:42,058
Then, you will draw your own high-quality illustrations.

285
00:13:45,803 --> 00:13:48,175
Metal objects have a big contrast.

286
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,162
I'm going to give it some highlights.

287
00:14:10,948 --> 00:14:13,037
Items that shine like this,

288
00:14:13,141 --> 00:14:15,268
to make it look brighter,

289
00:14:15,293 --> 00:14:16,290
the source part,

290
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:18,918
the wick of light should be close to white.

291
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,612
You need to raise the brightness.

292
00:14:20,637 --> 00:14:23,703
The further you go from there, the more saturation you can get.

293
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,735
Even if the saturation goes up,

294
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,120
when you look at it in black and white, the tone gets darker.

295
00:14:28,586 --> 00:14:30,239
First, raise the saturation.

296
00:14:30,241 --> 00:14:32,173
Then, lower the brightness.

297
00:14:32,198 --> 00:14:36,477
If you adjust the material of the item that shines,

298
00:14:36,478 --> 00:14:38,163
you can express a bit more.

299
00:15:11,393 --> 00:15:12,481
On the character's back,

300
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:15,088
to add a silhouette that looks a bit lacking,

301
00:15:15,241 --> 00:15:16,830
I've arranged the effects.

302
00:15:17,843 --> 00:15:20,415
To make this character look more intense,

303
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,528
I'll teach you how to compose it.

304
00:15:26,585 --> 00:15:28,824
I'll make the shadow have a bluish tone.

305
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:30,973
I'm going to make it look less white.

306
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:32,700
To make this look stronger,

307
00:15:32,725 --> 00:15:33,573
what should I do?

308
00:15:33,842 --> 00:15:36,588
Should we focus on the bottom?

309
00:15:36,612 --> 00:15:37,856
Or should we focus on the top?

310
00:15:37,881 --> 00:15:39,814
I tend to focus a lot on the top.

311
00:15:39,901 --> 00:15:40,949
It's the same as that.

312
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:43,130
So, as a result, like what we did in the beginning,

313
00:15:43,155 --> 00:15:44,772
among the cute and calm characters,

314
00:15:44,797 --> 00:15:46,441
it will look more like a cute character.

315
00:15:47,253 --> 00:15:49,601
And it is also intense.

316
00:15:49,626 --> 00:15:52,018
So, similar to the cute atmosphere,

317
00:15:52,043 --> 00:15:53,971
to make an inverted triangular silhouette,

318
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:56,649
you need to add more elements to the top part.

319
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,326
Let's place them simply.

320
00:16:06,801 --> 00:16:08,463
The fog that I put in here

321
00:16:08,488 --> 00:16:10,176
will be focused on the top.

322
00:16:12,101 --> 00:16:14,055
I said it's good to have a big contrast here.

323
00:16:14,094 --> 00:16:15,899
So to make a big contrast,

324
00:16:17,975 --> 00:16:19,796
I'm going to darken the edges.

325
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:21,686
Let's make the middle area brighter.

326
00:16:24,123 --> 00:16:27,579
Or instead of making middle part go bright all at once,

327
00:16:27,604 --> 00:16:29,633
I'll make it go darker like this.

328
00:16:30,518 --> 00:16:32,036
And then it gets brighter.

329
00:16:38,948 --> 00:16:40,986
It's good to use strong elements like this.

330
00:16:41,011 --> 00:16:42,216
It will be very effective.

331
00:16:48,595 --> 00:16:49,689
Like eyes

332
00:17:07,256 --> 00:17:09,533
that are similar to Sauron's eye in 'The Lord of the Rings'.

333
00:17:09,558 --> 00:17:10,732
I'll draw eyes.

334
00:17:15,068 --> 00:17:16,712
They don't have to have a clear form.

335
00:17:16,737 --> 00:17:18,429
They really don't.

336
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,401
I feel like I'm over there...

337
00:17:20,403 --> 00:17:21,419
It's okay to just do that.

338
00:17:24,491 --> 00:17:26,029
Using the Dodge Tool,

339
00:17:26,802 --> 00:17:28,121
make it bright.

340
00:17:34,013 --> 00:17:36,262
Add some effect particles around it.

341
00:17:38,633 --> 00:17:42,262
You can use lightning or liquids

342
00:17:42,287 --> 00:17:44,210
that we used before to give it a strong impression.

343
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,125
As the scale gets bigger,

344
00:17:55,127 --> 00:17:56,901
there will be more elements.

345
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,578
But on the other hand, you can't see the character's design.

346
00:17:59,603 --> 00:18:00,788
This is a flaw.

347
00:18:00,921 --> 00:18:03,437
So usually, with the characters that have original designs...

348
00:18:03,462 --> 00:18:05,913
the 2nd Awakening Illustration uses this kind of composition a lot.

349
00:18:06,533 --> 00:18:09,298
These days, there are many illustrations with a background.

350
00:18:09,323 --> 00:18:11,589
When that happens, like this,

351
00:18:11,695 --> 00:18:14,393
the background of the silhouette of the character is created.

352
00:18:19,797 --> 00:18:21,953
You can put in abandoned buildings or things like that.

353
00:18:23,256 --> 00:18:25,069
To suit your character's overall personality,

354
00:18:25,094 --> 00:18:27,214
give it a pointy look

355
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:29,111
to harmonize everything.

356
00:18:38,247 --> 00:18:40,018
Whenever I work on portrait illustrations,

357
00:18:40,043 --> 00:18:41,438
the background needs to be transparent.

358
00:18:41,463 --> 00:18:43,416
It's important

359
00:18:43,441 --> 00:18:44,306
to neatly finish off the outer line.

360
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:47,999
Otherwise, the background and the character will be mixed.

361
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:54,434
We can't predict how the background will go in.

362
00:18:54,507 --> 00:18:56,889
Sometimes, when I do outsourcing work,

363
00:18:57,335 --> 00:18:59,766
There are times when they ask me to work in a certain way

364
00:18:59,768 --> 00:19:01,835
because the background of this character will go in like this.

365
00:19:02,954 --> 00:19:04,366
But it doesn't happen often.

366
00:19:04,368 --> 00:19:06,099
Most of the time, I don't know what's in the background.

367
00:19:06,124 --> 00:19:07,969
I don't know what I should do.

368
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:10,398
So it's important to proceed

369
00:19:10,423 --> 00:19:11,999
so that any background can go in.

370
00:19:12,024 --> 00:19:14,493
When I work on my illustrations,

371
00:19:14,518 --> 00:19:15,653
it's one of the reasons I put gray in the background.

372
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:17,665
Whether the background is bright or dark,

373
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,872
I'm going to do it so that it fits the character tone.

374
00:19:20,478 --> 00:19:22,809
When the background suddenly gets bright like this,

375
00:19:22,811 --> 00:19:25,408
only the character looks a bit awkward.

376
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:28,269
To reduce that,

377
00:19:28,294 --> 00:19:31,337
there are many times when I do it with a gray background.

378
00:19:43,691 --> 00:19:45,422
I'll apply lighting to the background.

379
00:19:45,921 --> 00:19:47,792
Let's keep improving the quality.

380
00:19:48,965 --> 00:19:51,414
Today, I'm going to focus on describing this character.

381
00:19:51,574 --> 00:19:54,170
Other than that, how to describe each lighting...

382
00:19:54,195 --> 00:19:56,241
We actually did it in the full illustration stage.

383
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,209
I can't give these as much lighting as them.

384
00:20:00,234 --> 00:20:01,533
It's their characteristic.

385
00:20:01,558 --> 00:20:03,391
So today, from there,

386
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,398
we'll focus on the description.

387
00:20:23,777 --> 00:20:25,567
It'd be nice to add a bit of glitter.

388
00:20:48,954 --> 00:20:52,321
I'm putting in the silhouette that comes up from the bottom.

389
00:20:52,547 --> 00:20:54,681
The difference from the silhouette that goes down is

390
00:20:54,705 --> 00:20:56,705
that you'll be able to look up a bit more.

391
00:20:57,781 --> 00:20:58,719
With this illustration,

392
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,824
it's important to pull the viewer's gaze upwards.

393
00:21:00,825 --> 00:21:02,884
I keep putting it in like this.

394
00:21:04,649 --> 00:21:06,087
The highlights, too.

395
00:21:06,111 --> 00:21:07,349
Let's arrange them in advance.

396
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,532
If you describe this tentacle too much,

397
00:21:16,557 --> 00:21:18,049
it could be a bit gross.

398
00:21:18,074 --> 00:21:21,112
So, I only described it simply.

399
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,251
If it's shiny, it's kind of weird to look at, right?

400
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,462
I'm going to add more elements.

401
00:21:47,486 --> 00:21:48,392
So, let's get to it.

402
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:51,337
There are cracks in the characters on the floor, too.

403
00:21:51,361 --> 00:21:53,845
It's okay to put that at the bottom, too.

404
00:22:19,985 --> 00:22:22,124
Let's continue to compose like this.

405
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,071
In the eye socket of the character,

406
00:22:31,095 --> 00:22:32,060
I'm going to add an element

407
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:34,110
that will draw people's attention.

408
00:22:34,134 --> 00:22:35,829
At the bottom,

409
00:22:37,095 --> 00:22:38,735
there's a tentacle.

410
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:40,595
There's an object that gives a strong impression.

411
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:42,524
We need some elements

412
00:22:42,565 --> 00:22:43,821
that will draw attention to the upper area, too.

413
00:22:43,845 --> 00:22:45,071
For these elements,

414
00:22:45,095 --> 00:22:46,993
make the eyes sparkle

415
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:53,142
and make the middle part of the hat shine.

416
00:22:53,657 --> 00:22:54,470
Like that,

417
00:22:54,494 --> 00:22:55,696
for the lighting,

418
00:22:56,538 --> 00:22:58,798
make sure the viewers focus on the face.

419
00:22:58,822 --> 00:23:00,322
It'll be an effective way.

420
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:03,204
People always focus on

421
00:23:03,228 --> 00:23:05,056
where there's

422
00:23:05,081 --> 00:23:06,118
strong light.

423
00:23:06,579 --> 00:23:07,782
Please remember it.

424
00:23:07,806 --> 00:23:08,897
You have to use it.

425
00:23:33,095 --> 00:23:35,313
If this is the end,

426
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:39,624
you can guess that the illustration is complete.

427
00:23:42,563 --> 00:23:45,142
This is how you create a strong image.

428
00:23:46,087 --> 00:23:48,001
I'll try to describe it a little more.

429
00:23:49,954 --> 00:23:51,454
So that you can

430
00:23:51,478 --> 00:23:52,969
see it strongly.

431
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,098
The feeling of light coming out of the mouth, too.

432
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:16,470
To make it clear,

433
00:24:17,782 --> 00:24:19,392
make the bright part really bright.

434
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,595
Let's make sure to darken the dark areas.

435
00:24:22,767 --> 00:24:25,790
That way, you'll be able to focus more on the areas where the light comes out.

436
00:24:25,814 --> 00:24:27,446
For something to be sparkly,

437
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,720
it needs to be dark.

438
00:24:28,744 --> 00:24:29,630
Remember that?

439
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:31,352
It needs to be dark around here.

440
00:24:31,377 --> 00:24:34,207
So that the glittering parts stand out.

441
00:24:34,584 --> 00:24:35,977
Remember that,

442
00:24:36,001 --> 00:24:38,618
and let's make this area shine.

443
00:24:47,001 --> 00:24:48,531
And using this fire,

444
00:24:48,556 --> 00:24:50,934
I think you can use it as a linear element.

445
00:24:52,197 --> 00:24:57,080
Make the effect cover around the character.

446
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:05,157
It's something that draws attention to the top.

447
00:25:06,102 --> 00:25:07,719
And let's move on.

448
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,173
If you look at before and after putting it in,

449
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,628
when there's no description,

450
00:25:18,103 --> 00:25:20,345
and when there is description,

451
00:25:20,369 --> 00:25:23,306
if you look at it, it has a strong feeling.

452
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:24,626
So, you can concentrate towards the middle.

453
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,779
You'll be able to see it keep going up.

454
00:25:38,845 --> 00:25:40,556
The lighting is blue,

455
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,470
and the character's skin color isn't that strong either.

456
00:25:43,471 --> 00:25:46,212
When you add shadow, try to make it so that it almost has no saturation.

457
00:25:46,881 --> 00:25:48,657
So that it doesn't feel like a natural skin color.

458
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:49,501
I'll give it to you.

459
00:26:06,292 --> 00:26:08,720
Let's add this color, too.

460
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,142
A wick of light.

461
00:26:28,891 --> 00:26:31,078
I think it's the most focused on

462
00:26:31,103 --> 00:26:32,852
the middle section.

463
00:26:32,876 --> 00:26:34,243
The light is a bit close to a turquoise color.

464
00:26:34,267 --> 00:26:36,677
The further you go, the closer it'll be to a navy color.

465
00:26:36,702 --> 00:26:38,129
It's a great way...

466
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:42,345
We need to talk about natural brightness.

467
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:45,821
Everything has its own brightness.

468
00:26:45,846 --> 00:26:46,759
It's literal.

469
00:26:46,783 --> 00:26:48,337
What is the proper brightness?

470
00:26:48,361 --> 00:26:50,960
Even if I color pick a red one,

471
00:26:50,985 --> 00:26:51,970
it comes out like this.

472
00:26:52,907 --> 00:26:54,446
Even if you pick the top part of yellow,

473
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,405
it comes out like this.

474
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:57,306
If you look at this in black and white,

475
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:58,962
there's a difference in the brightness.

476
00:26:59,126 --> 00:27:01,063
If it goes over to navy,

477
00:27:01,094 --> 00:27:02,255
even though we took the same photo,

478
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:04,281
there's a huge difference in brightness.

479
00:27:04,438 --> 00:27:07,298
There's a difference in the brightness of each color.

480
00:27:07,323 --> 00:27:08,438
Use it.

481
00:27:08,462 --> 00:27:11,263
It's better to use different colors for bright and dark parts.

482
00:27:11,288 --> 00:27:12,220
It's very effective.

483
00:27:12,244 --> 00:27:13,767
I'll blend in the hues.

484
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:16,626
The bright part is a turquoise color with high intrinsic brightness.

485
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:18,771
Dark areas have low intrinsic brightness.

486
00:27:18,795 --> 00:27:20,540
If you put in the blue one,

487
00:27:20,564 --> 00:27:23,517
the concept of brightening and darkening becomes more definite.

488
00:27:23,994 --> 00:27:25,365
From a viewer's point of view,

489
00:27:25,389 --> 00:27:26,907
it looks like it's well organized.

490
00:27:29,063 --> 00:27:31,024
That's why for changing the hue,

491
00:27:31,048 --> 00:27:33,401
it's not like this is an absolute rule.

492
00:27:33,838 --> 00:27:36,059
If it's returned according to the proper brightness,

493
00:27:36,084 --> 00:27:38,206
the picture becomes more stable.

494
00:27:38,306 --> 00:27:40,290
So the closer you get to the source of the light,

495
00:27:40,314 --> 00:27:41,806
you'd use a lot of turquoise colors.

496
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:42,970
As the light gets farther away,

497
00:27:43,251 --> 00:27:46,610
if you mix navy or purple,

498
00:27:46,634 --> 00:27:49,407
It's applied better with blue illustrations.

499
00:27:50,282 --> 00:27:52,040
It's the same with the red illustrations.

500
00:27:52,064 --> 00:27:54,376
For the red ones, use yellow and red.

501
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,868
That's enough.

502
00:27:57,149 --> 00:27:59,032
If it gets worse, it'll go to purple.

503
00:28:09,501 --> 00:28:10,993
Sometimes, when painting shadows,

504
00:28:11,017 --> 00:28:11,959
there are people who color it darker

505
00:28:11,983 --> 00:28:13,720
for the edge of the shadow.

506
00:28:13,744 --> 00:28:14,681
Like this.

507
00:28:14,821 --> 00:28:15,837
Of course, this

508
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,438
is a kind of lighting that can be applied.

509
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:18,759
Unless it's a strong lighting,

510
00:28:18,783 --> 00:28:20,540
you don't get shadows like this.

511
00:28:20,564 --> 00:28:22,888
And if you give shadows like this,

512
00:28:24,227 --> 00:28:26,649
the edges stand out a lot.

513
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:29,876
So if it's a simple coloring method, it's okay to use that method,

514
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,392
and if you use it with a lot of description,

515
00:28:32,417 --> 00:28:34,445
it could be a bit burdensome to look at.

516
00:28:34,491 --> 00:28:36,165
So, whenever you put in a boundary color,

517
00:28:36,189 --> 00:28:38,575
when you look at the tone, it's going to be in the middle.

518
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,415
Let's put it in while paying more attention to it.

519
00:29:02,212 --> 00:29:03,352
If you do this much,

520
00:29:03,376 --> 00:29:04,148
what do you think?

521
00:29:04,149 --> 00:29:05,735
Do you think

522
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,157
it looks like a mobile game illustration?

523
00:29:08,876 --> 00:29:09,868
To be honest,

524
00:29:09,899 --> 00:29:11,532
when working on portrait illustrations,

525
00:29:11,556 --> 00:29:13,454
that can be one of your own evaluation criteria.

526
00:29:13,478 --> 00:29:15,251
What I've been working on right now,

527
00:29:15,384 --> 00:29:18,423
I'm not sure if it's okay for me to put it into the game.

528
00:29:18,447 --> 00:29:19,134
When you do yours,

529
00:29:19,158 --> 00:29:20,665
if you think it wouldn't be that weird,

530
00:29:20,689 --> 00:29:21,705
then that illustration is probably okay.

531
00:29:23,509 --> 00:29:24,649
But if it's not enough,

532
00:29:24,673 --> 00:29:26,899
then, we should focus more on the drawing.

533
00:29:27,505 --> 00:29:29,579
So for those who are preparing portrait illustrations,

534
00:29:29,603 --> 00:29:32,142
there are people who have a target game genre in mind.

535
00:29:33,681 --> 00:29:35,571
If you don't have it, I want you to make it now.

536
00:29:35,595 --> 00:29:38,134
You can make your own target genre.

537
00:29:39,618 --> 00:29:42,532
Focus on those kind of drawings.

538
00:29:42,596 --> 00:29:43,982
Even when we look at them side by side,

539
00:29:44,006 --> 00:29:46,282
if you don't feel they're awkward,

540
00:29:46,307 --> 00:29:47,610
then you can

541
00:29:47,634 --> 00:29:49,634
already get a job somewhere.

542
00:30:05,446 --> 00:30:08,187
But for those who want to practice,

543
00:30:08,275 --> 00:30:10,142
you can narrow down the target like that.

544
00:30:13,024 --> 00:30:14,720
In the end, later on,

545
00:30:14,744 --> 00:30:16,251
no matter what game you're outsourcing for,

546
00:30:16,275 --> 00:30:18,275
I hope you can have the right abilities for it.

547
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:20,852
I'll tell you one more time when I finish my class, but,

548
00:30:20,876 --> 00:30:23,415
I hope students will ultimately

549
00:30:23,525 --> 00:30:25,329
have a completely different style than they did before.

550
00:30:25,505 --> 00:30:27,907
For example, for those who draw casual illustrations,

551
00:30:27,931 --> 00:30:30,118
even if there's a realistic style illustration,

552
00:30:30,186 --> 00:30:34,931
if I focus on practicing for 2 to 3 weeks,

553
00:30:34,956 --> 00:30:38,557
you need to become a person who can express yourself to a certain extent.

554
00:30:39,009 --> 00:30:40,235
That's what I want.

555
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,344
This is the ultimate goal of an illustrator.

556
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:46,101
In order for that to happen, the ability to analyze references is essential.

557
00:30:46,126 --> 00:30:49,712
The ability to decide things is critical.

558
00:30:49,736 --> 00:30:51,634
This is important when you draw realistically.

559
00:30:51,658 --> 00:30:53,188
In my drawing, I should do it like this.

560
00:30:53,212 --> 00:30:55,563
Such determination plays an important role.

561
00:30:56,102 --> 00:30:58,563
So, continue to improve on those things.

562
00:30:58,587 --> 00:31:01,165
If you become a person who can draw anything,

563
00:31:01,189 --> 00:31:01,985
for me, I think that person

564
00:31:02,009 --> 00:31:04,961
will be highly qualified as a professional.

565
00:31:07,774 --> 00:31:10,899
Of course, it's important to draw well.

566
00:31:11,368 --> 00:31:12,653
To make attractive pictures.

567
00:31:12,677 --> 00:31:14,899
Being popular is important, of course,

568
00:31:14,923 --> 00:31:17,001
but if you want to work as a professional,

569
00:31:17,025 --> 00:31:19,392
I hope you think about it as well.

570
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:24,233
"I don't know if I'm a person who can cope with anything".

571
00:31:26,368 --> 00:31:27,782
There are people like that sometimes.

572
00:31:27,806 --> 00:31:30,118
If you're really good at drawing,

573
00:31:30,142 --> 00:31:33,720
if you don't have many preferences,

574
00:31:33,821 --> 00:31:36,657
or the content of the drawing itself is limited,

575
00:31:36,852 --> 00:31:39,087
or a case in which you aren't outsourced often,

576
00:31:39,346 --> 00:31:40,993
if that's the case,

577
00:31:41,017 --> 00:31:42,720
you might think it was because you weren't good enough.

578
00:31:42,744 --> 00:31:44,843
There are people who think like that, too.

579
00:31:45,407 --> 00:31:48,321
It could be true,

580
00:31:48,517 --> 00:31:50,024
but in most cases,

581
00:31:50,048 --> 00:31:52,048
you can easily get hired,

582
00:31:52,072 --> 00:31:54,477
more than you think.

583
00:31:55,548 --> 00:31:58,579
You'll easily be hired more than you think.

584
00:31:58,603 --> 00:32:01,563
But whether the person actually earns money or not,

585
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:02,813
luck also applies.

586
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:06,032
I don't know if that person can do various things.

587
00:32:06,056 --> 00:32:08,798
It depends on that.

588
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,071
The characters that I draw often,

589
00:32:12,095 --> 00:32:14,563
they don't always come out right.

590
00:32:14,587 --> 00:32:15,923
A character that fits perfectly...

591
00:32:16,551 --> 00:32:18,892
Say a company needs a male character.

592
00:32:18,916 --> 00:32:20,506
If this person can draw a male character,

593
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:21,532
then they'll be hired.

594
00:32:21,556 --> 00:32:24,142
But there are some people who are only good at drawing female characters.

595
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:26,712
I don't think it's good to hire them for that work.

596
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:30,829
So later, if you want to make money,

597
00:32:30,853 --> 00:32:34,125
and if you want to be hired to work in different areas,

598
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:36,836
it's important to keep training yourself by drawing various things.

599
00:32:41,282 --> 00:32:44,524
You'll be able to see that the overall frame is set.

600
00:32:44,548 --> 00:32:46,220
When the frame is set,

601
00:32:46,244 --> 00:32:48,360
let's take a different approach.

602
00:32:48,587 --> 00:32:49,696
This time, really...

603
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,524
It's only rarely used.

604
00:32:51,954 --> 00:32:53,907
Let's move away from the strong feeling.

605
00:32:53,932 --> 00:32:57,595
We're going to do an illustration that gives sentimental vibes.

606
00:32:59,251 --> 00:33:01,524
It's a sentimental illustration,

607
00:33:01,548 --> 00:33:03,352
but there's nothing specific.

608
00:33:03,376 --> 00:33:06,509
When it comes to sentimental illustrations,

609
00:33:06,533 --> 00:33:08,806
they're usually in low saturated colors.

610
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,947
The part that shines is subtle,

611
00:33:10,948 --> 00:33:12,938
that's the kind of illustration I use a lot.

612
00:33:12,962 --> 00:33:15,110
Many illustrators from Taiwan

613
00:33:15,134 --> 00:33:16,649
use those colors a lot.

614
00:33:16,673 --> 00:33:18,118
So if you want to express

615
00:33:18,142 --> 00:33:19,743
that kind of feeling,

616
00:33:19,768 --> 00:33:21,071
what do you need?

617
00:33:24,657 --> 00:33:27,377
It's a perfect method for this character.

618
00:33:27,401 --> 00:33:28,286
This is because,

619
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,533
the design of this character is mostly white.

620
00:33:30,582 --> 00:33:31,822
It's a monotone color.

621
00:33:31,987 --> 00:33:33,855
I'm saying that there's not much color in the whole thing.

622
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,495
So, when you do that,

623
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,555
from this white color,

624
00:33:37,579 --> 00:33:39,039
in the process of adding light and shadow,

625
00:33:39,063 --> 00:33:41,326
how would you change the color of the light and shadow?

626
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:45,076
Depending on how you change the color,

627
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,887
the mood of the illustration changes drastically.

628
00:33:47,953 --> 00:33:50,616
The layers that have light and shadow,

629
00:33:53,876 --> 00:33:55,424
these layers,

630
00:34:04,884 --> 00:34:07,278
back them up first.

631
00:34:21,433 --> 00:34:25,978
Just by changing the color of these layers,

632
00:34:26,305 --> 00:34:28,649
the feeling of the illustration changes a lot.

633
00:34:29,146 --> 00:34:30,360
But this...

634
00:34:33,663 --> 00:34:36,426
The color palettes in the back and the whole thing.

635
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:38,180
I'm going to reduce the saturation.

636
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:56,170
I'll reduce the saturation.

637
00:35:05,964 --> 00:35:07,455
I'll balance it like this.

638
00:35:07,479 --> 00:35:08,570
I'll create one Layer.

639
00:35:08,748 --> 00:35:11,347
The layer I'm going to use this time is the Overlay Layer.

640
00:35:21,816 --> 00:35:22,789
Like this.

641
00:35:22,813 --> 00:35:25,161
I'll paint different colors here and there.

642
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:28,308
If it gets dark, I'll go straight to purple

643
00:35:29,409 --> 00:35:31,063
Near the part where the light is coming from,

644
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,313
let's give it a blue hue.

645
00:35:32,919 --> 00:35:34,337
Or depending on the situation,

646
00:35:34,361 --> 00:35:36,944
if you want to curl this side up a bit, apply green colors.

647
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,791
First, make it colorful.

648
00:35:48,799 --> 00:35:51,014
You can color it in a pretty way.

649
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:52,468
There's no strict rule.

650
00:35:57,001 --> 00:35:58,798
But the usual condition of a sentimental illustration is

651
00:35:58,822 --> 00:36:01,134
having a low saturation overall.

652
00:36:01,298 --> 00:36:04,458
The point is to use a variety of hues.

653
00:36:05,167 --> 00:36:07,759
Since it's lowly saturated and has low contrast...

654
00:36:07,784 --> 00:36:10,950
The conditions needed to be the highlight of the previous drawing.

655
00:36:10,974 --> 00:36:13,833
There were things like strong saturation or big contrast.

656
00:36:13,857 --> 00:36:16,880
So, there's no saturation or contrast.

657
00:36:18,842 --> 00:36:21,956
That means that the seasoning becomes bland, if we compare it to cooking.

658
00:36:22,392 --> 00:36:24,096
Then that bland seasoning,

659
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,014
you need something else to cover it up with.

660
00:36:26,229 --> 00:36:28,137
That's what makes it a hue.

661
00:36:28,162 --> 00:36:30,567
So instead of reducing the contrast,

662
00:36:30,591 --> 00:36:33,123
it's a case where you use a variety of hues.

663
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:35,850
There are a lot of coloring methods like that these days.

664
00:36:35,874 --> 00:36:39,004
So the reason why border colors are used a lot...

665
00:36:39,028 --> 00:36:40,836
In a way, it's relatively recent.

666
00:36:41,484 --> 00:36:44,309
Recently, Taiwanese illustrations

667
00:36:44,334 --> 00:36:46,255
and Chinese illustrations became more popular.

668
00:36:46,279 --> 00:36:49,522
Among those who draw casual pictures,

669
00:36:49,546 --> 00:36:50,886
I can see those styles a lot.

670
00:36:51,115 --> 00:36:53,414
So even when you give it a border color,

671
00:36:53,439 --> 00:36:54,877
use different hues.

672
00:36:57,613 --> 00:36:59,749
It's one of my favorite coloring methods.

673
00:37:01,257 --> 00:37:02,938
I'll increase the number of hues as much as I can.

674
00:37:02,962 --> 00:37:04,451
The contrast will be decreased, too.

675
00:37:04,475 --> 00:37:05,467
We'll do it like that.

676
00:37:05,866 --> 00:37:07,448
As the contrast decreases,

677
00:37:07,472 --> 00:37:09,536
the drawing itself makes it easier to see.

678
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:12,001
So when you want to give a strong impression,

679
00:37:12,025 --> 00:37:13,464
it might not be appropriate.

680
00:37:13,488 --> 00:37:15,097
The strong feeling,

681
00:37:15,121 --> 00:37:17,093
it literally needs to be strong.

682
00:37:17,118 --> 00:37:19,011
There should be a big contrast.

683
00:37:19,219 --> 00:37:22,150
In this process, the contrast decreases automatically.

684
00:37:22,174 --> 00:37:23,585
If you use a certain color,

685
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:25,097
it's inevitable that

686
00:37:25,121 --> 00:37:26,426
it becomes less simple than the previous one.

687
00:37:26,802 --> 00:37:29,174
If you look at it in person,

688
00:37:30,231 --> 00:37:32,697
the first thing you look at at a glance is the former one.

689
00:37:32,798 --> 00:37:35,801
But it gives off a subtle glow.

690
00:37:35,895 --> 00:37:37,903
For those who like it,

691
00:37:37,927 --> 00:37:40,218
you'll be able to get a good response.

692
00:37:42,712 --> 00:37:45,924
So it's all about the situation.

693
00:37:46,893 --> 00:37:48,805
This one needs to be more intense.

694
00:37:48,829 --> 00:37:50,026
That's the way it should be.

695
00:37:50,064 --> 00:37:51,916
If you say so, then make it more intense.

696
00:37:52,096 --> 00:37:54,380
If you give up on the intensity,

697
00:37:54,404 --> 00:37:56,085
you may want to make it sentimental.

698
00:37:56,989 --> 00:37:59,245
It doesn't have to be strong.

699
00:37:59,269 --> 00:38:01,220
Then make it so.

700
00:38:02,678 --> 00:38:03,918
Illustrating is always like that.

701
00:38:03,942 --> 00:38:06,099
According to what you want to express,

702
00:38:06,123 --> 00:38:07,605
we do it little by little.

703
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,881
When you illustrate for the first time,

704
00:38:14,905 --> 00:38:16,724
your route will change a lot in the middle.

705
00:38:16,748 --> 00:38:19,110
You might not express it the way you want it.

706
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,724
When that happens, you can always give self-feedback.

707
00:38:21,896 --> 00:38:23,471
Do some self-feedback.

708
00:38:23,765 --> 00:38:25,609
This one is kind of...

709
00:38:25,633 --> 00:38:27,171
It has a mix of two feelings.

710
00:38:27,195 --> 00:38:28,698
This often happens a lot.

711
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:31,603
Someone who's good at doing cute things...

712
00:38:31,627 --> 00:38:33,180
I wanted to draw something calm

713
00:38:33,204 --> 00:38:34,735
but it came out as cute.

714
00:38:35,261 --> 00:38:37,605
Or at first, there was a high contrast,

715
00:38:37,629 --> 00:38:39,039
so you wanted to give a strong impression.

716
00:38:39,063 --> 00:38:41,559
But after illustrating it, there was low contrast.

717
00:38:41,584 --> 00:38:43,400
It wasn't as strong as you thought or...

718
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,843
You'll give yourself feedback like that a lot.

719
00:38:45,867 --> 00:38:48,222
Whenever that happens, remember those things well.

720
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,460
And fix them later on.

721
00:38:50,484 --> 00:38:51,703
Even though it's like this,

722
00:38:52,585 --> 00:38:54,409
make it red all of a sudden.

723
00:38:56,101 --> 00:38:59,103
I went over the navy color and gave it some light and shadow

724
00:39:03,033 --> 00:39:04,537
and used a variety of hues.

725
00:39:05,962 --> 00:39:08,259
Even if you change the color, when you see it in black and white,

726
00:39:08,284 --> 00:39:10,021
as long as the tone is maintained well,

727
00:39:10,803 --> 00:39:12,789
within coloring,

728
00:39:12,814 --> 00:39:15,623
you can use hues quite freely.

729
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:18,139
That's why when there's a mint color bead,

730
00:39:18,163 --> 00:39:19,559
even if I put orange on it,

731
00:39:19,583 --> 00:39:21,505
it's smoother than you think.

732
00:39:23,836 --> 00:39:25,489
When you look at it in black and white, the tone

733
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,698
will be stable.

734
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:38,416
If you want to make the beads look translucent,

735
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,538
this is okay, too.

736
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:49,532
I think this will break the dimensional effect.

737
00:39:49,556 --> 00:39:51,881
I think it needs to be bright on the top and dark on the bottom.

738
00:39:51,905 --> 00:39:53,765
Now break it on purpose

739
00:39:53,789 --> 00:39:56,086
to make it look transparent.

740
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:58,637
To put it another way,

741
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:01,216
you can say that it's three-dimensional.

742
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,609
Transparent liquids don't have a three-dimensional effect.

743
00:40:03,683 --> 00:40:06,770
So you have to make sure it doesn't look three-dimensional.

744
00:40:06,794 --> 00:40:08,851
You can think of it as being more transparent.

745
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:13,405
So, the bottom part that's supposed to be dark

746
00:40:13,429 --> 00:40:15,663
it's designed to be bright right now,

747
00:40:15,687 --> 00:40:18,412
so that's why this bead looks more transparent.

748
00:40:20,778 --> 00:40:23,517
It's the same when you color skin.

749
00:40:23,549 --> 00:40:24,513
When you're coloring skin,

750
00:40:24,537 --> 00:40:26,213
you may want to draw more transparent skin.

751
00:40:26,237 --> 00:40:26,949
To do that,

752
00:40:26,973 --> 00:40:29,115
please brighten up the areas that need to be dark.

753
00:40:29,529 --> 00:40:30,784
There will be disadvantages to it.

754
00:40:30,808 --> 00:40:31,814
What's the disadvantage?

755
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:33,064
You can't really see the light and shadow.

756
00:40:33,173 --> 00:40:35,557
Then, it's hard to see the direction of the lighting.

757
00:40:36,077 --> 00:40:38,348
Since there's no clear shadow,

758
00:40:38,373 --> 00:40:39,683
the lighting won't come to life

759
00:40:39,708 --> 00:40:41,729
as you intended.

760
00:40:41,753 --> 00:40:44,395
That's true, but the clear feeling of the skin itself

761
00:40:44,419 --> 00:40:45,812
looks pretty.

762
00:40:45,836 --> 00:40:48,703
In an illustration where you want to show your character's skin with charm,

763
00:40:48,727 --> 00:40:50,351
it's a method that is used very often.

764
00:41:02,568 --> 00:41:04,693
If you look at it, rather than the lighting,

765
00:41:04,717 --> 00:41:06,010
the transparent feeling of the skin itself...

766
00:41:06,034 --> 00:41:07,838
You'll be able to see it well.

767
00:41:09,354 --> 00:41:10,794
With Japanese coloring methods,

768
00:41:10,818 --> 00:41:12,442
it's a method that's used a lot.

769
00:41:17,457 --> 00:41:19,799
Even in this situation, you can keep changing the hues.

770
00:41:19,824 --> 00:41:20,829
Let's get into it.

771
00:41:26,485 --> 00:41:29,332
Since a lot of blue was used,

772
00:41:30,263 --> 00:41:31,873
if you use a red color,

773
00:41:31,897 --> 00:41:34,452
There's a high possibility that this part will be highlighted.

774
00:41:34,644 --> 00:41:36,014
It stands out.

775
00:41:36,506 --> 00:41:38,152
It's all blue.

776
00:41:38,176 --> 00:41:40,083
If it's red, it will definitely stand out a lot.

777
00:41:40,108 --> 00:41:42,619
So, focusing on the middle part that needs to stand out,

778
00:41:42,643 --> 00:41:44,459
you're going to add a lot of red.

779
00:42:08,499 --> 00:42:10,077
Just like I told you, whether it's

780
00:42:10,101 --> 00:42:12,044
Taiwanese style, Japanese style,

781
00:42:12,068 --> 00:42:14,452
or Korean style... in the end,

782
00:42:14,476 --> 00:42:16,313
these are things that I decided on my own.

783
00:42:16,648 --> 00:42:19,076
That's how you study.

784
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,652
Generally speaking,

785
00:42:20,676 --> 00:42:22,676
it's not all like that.

786
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,749
The coloring method from Japan

787
00:42:23,773 --> 00:42:25,479
feels a bit flat.

788
00:42:25,504 --> 00:42:27,414
But the texture itself is pretty.

789
00:42:27,438 --> 00:42:28,863
There are a lot of times when the texture is emphasized.

790
00:42:29,063 --> 00:42:30,258
The Korean illustration has

791
00:42:30,282 --> 00:42:32,513
many realistic descriptions.

792
00:42:32,537 --> 00:42:35,290
The importance of description is high.

793
00:42:35,314 --> 00:42:36,860
It's a characteristic of Korean illustrations.

794
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,919
So the description is very solid

795
00:42:39,943 --> 00:42:41,431
and it looks stable.

796
00:42:41,455 --> 00:42:43,330
The color itself looks a bit light

797
00:42:43,354 --> 00:42:44,821
and the skin looks natural.

798
00:42:44,845 --> 00:42:46,789
This doesn't happen often

799
00:42:47,549 --> 00:42:49,040
in Taiwan,

800
00:42:49,065 --> 00:42:50,938
which has low saturated illustrations.

801
00:42:50,962 --> 00:42:52,776
The point is to use a variety of hues.

802
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,503
I use the tertiary colors very actively

803
00:42:57,477 --> 00:42:58,763
for it to be

804
00:42:58,787 --> 00:43:01,100
a sentimental illustration.

805
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:06,653
In China, red is used more.

806
00:43:06,678 --> 00:43:09,317
While studying like that,

807
00:43:09,341 --> 00:43:10,603
I divided them up based on how I feel.

808
00:43:10,627 --> 00:43:11,827
Students, please

809
00:43:11,851 --> 00:43:13,209
share what you've drawn

810
00:43:13,233 --> 00:43:15,681
and think about it.

811
00:43:19,582 --> 00:43:21,143
I'm going to change the hues.

812
00:43:21,167 --> 00:43:22,371
If you continue like this,

813
00:43:40,391 --> 00:43:41,562
compared to the previous one,

814
00:43:41,586 --> 00:43:43,635
it will feel less intense.

815
00:43:43,971 --> 00:43:46,171
With certainty and subtlety,

816
00:43:46,456 --> 00:43:48,628
you'll be able to see that

817
00:43:48,652 --> 00:43:49,637
this atmosphere can be used a lot.

818
00:43:50,306 --> 00:43:51,867
So that you can see it better,

819
00:43:51,891 --> 00:43:54,133
let's make a fuss in the background.

820
00:44:13,777 --> 00:44:15,955
The bright part is mostly turquoise.

821
00:44:15,979 --> 00:44:17,791
For the dark part, focus on purple.

822
00:44:17,815 --> 00:44:19,815
It's the same here.

823
00:44:42,862 --> 00:44:45,313
Be careful not to make the contrasts too high.

824
00:44:49,888 --> 00:44:52,345
The contrast needs to be low.

825
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:54,241
You can see the subtle atmosphere.

826
00:45:00,116 --> 00:45:01,731
In these soft parts...

827
00:45:01,755 --> 00:45:04,298
When you make a calm illustration,

828
00:45:04,322 --> 00:45:05,810
it'll be very effective.

829
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,920
So when I make a calm illustration,

830
00:45:07,944 --> 00:45:09,745
hues like this

831
00:45:09,769 --> 00:45:11,286
fit very well.

832
00:45:34,744 --> 00:45:36,940
Use as little saturation as possible.

833
00:45:36,964 --> 00:45:39,077
Don't forget that.

834
00:45:41,863 --> 00:45:42,906
By pinpointing this,

835
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:45,185
I'm going to use it to fix the saturation of the important parts.

836
00:45:46,046 --> 00:45:48,438
It's close to the concept of not using high saturation that much.

837
00:46:32,901 --> 00:46:34,429
Make the background dense.

838
00:46:34,453 --> 00:46:36,287
The characters can be simple.

839
00:46:36,311 --> 00:46:37,616
It's the same here.

840
00:46:37,864 --> 00:46:40,400
That way, the background and the character can be clearly distinguished.

841
00:46:45,244 --> 00:46:49,000
Density distribution, regardless of the coloring method,

842
00:46:49,386 --> 00:46:51,664
it's a theory that needs to be included.

843
00:47:11,436 --> 00:47:13,225
Before, and after.

844
00:47:19,256 --> 00:47:20,844
It's different to a certain extent,

845
00:47:20,868 --> 00:47:22,208
but this is also charming.

846
00:47:22,232 --> 00:47:24,424
That's how it's going to be made.

847
00:47:24,774 --> 00:47:27,862
The effects on the outer boundaries...

848
00:47:27,919 --> 00:47:29,919
I made it so that it fits the mood of the drawing.

849
00:47:31,256 --> 00:47:33,330
It'd be nice to add a bit of low saturation.

850
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,374
On the edge,

851
00:47:46,567 --> 00:47:48,291
let's take it out in purple.

852
00:48:13,936 --> 00:48:15,265
If you make it like this,

853
00:48:15,289 --> 00:48:17,446
you can see the mood being set.

854
00:48:17,541 --> 00:48:18,930
Let's sort it out.

855
00:48:18,955 --> 00:48:21,530
Let's summarize what we've done.

856
00:48:23,797 --> 00:48:25,400
The character illustration.

857
00:48:25,601 --> 00:48:27,008
Portrait illustration.

858
00:48:27,032 --> 00:48:28,596
Same as a full illustration,

859
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:31,288
they have the same ways for directing things depending on the mood.

860
00:48:31,312 --> 00:48:32,943
Nothing's that different.

861
00:48:32,967 --> 00:48:34,449
Additionally, today,

862
00:48:34,473 --> 00:48:36,822
I just told you how to make it sentimental.

863
00:48:36,846 --> 00:48:39,434
I actually chose this word, too.

864
00:48:39,459 --> 00:48:40,677
It's a Taiwanese coloring method.

865
00:48:40,963 --> 00:48:42,916
I think it's okay to look at it like that.

866
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:44,474
It's a color scheme that you can see a lot these days.

867
00:48:44,498 --> 00:48:46,215
I wanted to introduce this to you.

868
00:48:46,239 --> 00:48:48,164
For those who like this,

869
00:48:48,188 --> 00:48:50,124
use it while being conscious of it.

870
00:48:50,148 --> 00:48:51,630
I think it'll be okay.

871
00:48:51,654 --> 00:48:54,140
The important thing is to use low saturation.

872
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:56,952
Use a variety of colors to match the amount of information.

873
00:48:57,929 --> 00:49:00,042
And when you change the color,

874
00:49:00,066 --> 00:49:01,647
the area close to the light source is

875
00:49:01,671 --> 00:49:03,266
the color that has a higher specific brightness.

876
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:04,920
The further away from the light source,

877
00:49:04,945 --> 00:49:06,842
if you use a color with low specific brightness,

878
00:49:06,866 --> 00:49:08,664
when you set the tones,

879
00:49:08,688 --> 00:49:11,128
and when you put it in black and white,

880
00:49:11,152 --> 00:49:12,677
it'll be more stable.

881
00:49:12,701 --> 00:49:15,042
It will help you complete the illustration.

882
00:49:16,691 --> 00:49:18,625
When you make an illustration with a strong impression,

883
00:49:18,649 --> 00:49:20,866
the feeling of shining coming from the light source,

884
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:22,663
it's important to make sure the feeling is there.

885
00:49:22,688 --> 00:49:25,383
And in order for the gaze to come to the center,

886
00:49:25,407 --> 00:49:27,094
so that you don't look away,

887
00:49:27,118 --> 00:49:28,451
block some of the areas.

888
00:49:28,475 --> 00:49:29,900
That's also important.

889
00:49:30,016 --> 00:49:31,874
This sharp silhouette

890
00:49:31,899 --> 00:49:33,991
shows the character's aggressive tendencies/

891
00:49:34,277 --> 00:49:35,844
By using some kind of firework...

892
00:49:35,868 --> 00:49:37,556
Head from the bottom up

893
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:39,374
and draw attention above.

894
00:49:39,398 --> 00:49:40,525
And so on...

895
00:49:40,549 --> 00:49:43,664
If it's an illustration that looks like a triangle,

896
00:49:43,688 --> 00:49:45,539
make the gaze go upwards.

897
00:49:45,563 --> 00:49:47,932
This is the cute illustration that I did earlier.

898
00:49:47,956 --> 00:49:49,339
It would have been the same way.

899
00:49:50,491 --> 00:49:52,357
Compared to the calm illustration,

900
00:49:52,382 --> 00:49:54,126
it became an illustration

901
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:55,155
that draws a lot of attention to the top.

902
00:49:55,179 --> 00:49:58,359
Let's test how the gaze flows.

903
00:49:58,383 --> 00:49:59,447
Let's take a look.

904
00:50:03,775 --> 00:50:05,333
This illustration at the top is

905
00:50:05,357 --> 00:50:07,201
the type you'll see the most frequently.

906
00:50:08,069 --> 00:50:09,964
And then we'll look at the bottom.

907
00:50:09,988 --> 00:50:12,542
When the background goes in from this composition,

908
00:50:12,566 --> 00:50:14,451
you draw the character like this.

909
00:50:14,476 --> 00:50:16,327
The direction of the gaze

910
00:50:16,351 --> 00:50:18,550
and the posture of the character, too.

911
00:50:18,574 --> 00:50:21,019
The basic gaze flow is to go to the bottom left.

912
00:50:21,043 --> 00:50:22,805
I cut it off and went in.

913
00:50:24,412 --> 00:50:26,164
Why would you do that?

914
00:50:26,188 --> 00:50:27,286
I explained it before.

915
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:29,346
Cut the gaze flow from time to time.

916
00:50:29,370 --> 00:50:31,656
And make the character have a stronger impression.

917
00:50:31,681 --> 00:50:34,395
On the other hand, it was to increase the viewer's concentration.

918
00:50:36,635 --> 00:50:38,195
The bottom part is the opposite.

919
00:50:38,219 --> 00:50:39,815
The flow of the character's eyes,

920
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:41,178
and the overall flow,

921
00:50:41,202 --> 00:50:42,655
it's very smooth.

922
00:50:42,679 --> 00:50:44,324
It moves on smoothly.

923
00:50:44,348 --> 00:50:45,546
It's like this.

924
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:48,420
The silhouette goes round at the bottom.

925
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:51,341
You'll see there's a lot focused at the bottom.

926
00:50:51,834 --> 00:50:53,934
The character's hat and the silhouette...

927
00:50:53,958 --> 00:50:55,880
There's nothing that sticks out.

928
00:50:55,904 --> 00:50:58,984
You'll be able to see that it's settled calmly.

929
00:50:59,008 --> 00:51:01,029
So, it gives a very different vibe

930
00:51:01,053 --> 00:51:02,663
from the illustration at the top.

931
00:51:02,764 --> 00:51:04,379
The illustration that I made today

932
00:51:04,403 --> 00:51:06,987
uses silhouettes that stands out all over the top,

933
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:09,388
so that the gaze that went down

934
00:51:09,646 --> 00:51:11,057
can go back up.

935
00:51:11,082 --> 00:51:13,308
And I made it so that it spreads out.

936
00:51:13,396 --> 00:51:15,716
What's the point of spreading it out here?

937
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:18,252
It makes the scale of the painting look bigger.

938
00:51:18,474 --> 00:51:20,837
So we play mobile games.

939
00:51:20,861 --> 00:51:22,030
When I draw an illustration like that,

940
00:51:22,054 --> 00:51:23,515
there's a limit to the canvas size.

941
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:26,448
It can't stick out from the standard mobile screen size.

942
00:51:26,472 --> 00:51:28,167
And we don't draw the background.

943
00:51:28,191 --> 00:51:30,828
It can't stand out, so in the limitations of the composition,

944
00:51:30,852 --> 00:51:32,187
that person is a little more...

945
00:51:32,211 --> 00:51:34,154
When I see this character,

946
00:51:34,178 --> 00:51:36,207
we need to make the silhouette look wider.

947
00:51:36,231 --> 00:51:38,117
In other words, we use optical illusions.

948
00:51:38,142 --> 00:51:39,758
If you put it in with an arrow, we go in that direction.

949
00:51:39,782 --> 00:51:40,809
It draws the attention.

950
00:51:40,833 --> 00:51:42,584
I'm going to use it to go outside.

951
00:51:42,608 --> 00:51:44,935
It's an illustration that draws your attention.

952
00:51:44,959 --> 00:51:45,830
It's like that.

953
00:51:48,623 --> 00:51:51,050
I used a silhouette similar to this one

954
00:51:52,863 --> 00:51:55,752
but the hues and silhouettes that rise above

955
00:51:55,776 --> 00:51:57,286
will be shown less.

956
00:51:57,423 --> 00:51:59,978
There's a lot of attention drawn to the bottom.

957
00:52:00,002 --> 00:52:01,192
It's like that.

958
00:52:01,777 --> 00:52:03,934
When I go into sentimental direction,

959
00:52:03,958 --> 00:52:05,837
since it's good to make it calm,

960
00:52:05,861 --> 00:52:08,763
as much as we did at the top,

961
00:52:08,787 --> 00:52:10,787
I preferred not to give it a dynamic vibe.

962
00:52:10,868 --> 00:52:13,573
So even in the process of organizing it,

963
00:52:13,597 --> 00:52:15,454
for the items that are rising,

964
00:52:15,478 --> 00:52:17,094
I didn't give any lighting to them.

965
00:52:18,375 --> 00:52:21,072
I didn't highlight the thimble in the back.

966
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:22,492
Using those methods,

967
00:52:22,516 --> 00:52:24,680
so that the gaze can be focused in the middle,

968
00:52:24,704 --> 00:52:26,469
so that it can be calmer,

969
00:52:26,494 --> 00:52:27,570
that's what you need to do.

970
00:52:27,594 --> 00:52:28,920
The actual illustration...

971
00:52:28,944 --> 00:52:30,155
If you look at this illustration,

972
00:52:30,179 --> 00:52:31,945
the part that you see a lot,

973
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:34,445
you'll be able to see the height difference.

974
00:52:36,741 --> 00:52:39,316
With portrait illustrations,

975
00:52:39,341 --> 00:52:42,151
make an illustration that fits the mood you want to show.

976
00:52:42,176 --> 00:52:43,785
So, the ability to compose

977
00:52:43,809 --> 00:52:45,120
is very important.

978
00:52:45,144 --> 00:52:46,441
Whenever you draw,

979
00:52:46,465 --> 00:52:47,961
think about these things.

980
00:52:47,985 --> 00:52:51,199
I hope you learn how to go into it while calculating things your head.

981
00:52:51,557 --> 00:52:54,694
I worked on a portrait illustration today.

982
00:52:54,719 --> 00:52:56,274
Full illustration, portrait illustration.

983
00:52:56,275 --> 00:52:57,641
I worked on most of them.

984
00:52:57,665 --> 00:52:59,566
I'm going to describe it next time,

985
00:52:59,625 --> 00:53:01,050
but whatever the illustration may be,

986
00:53:01,074 --> 00:53:03,543
you may have noticed that the basic framework is the same.

987
00:53:03,567 --> 00:53:05,340
The basic framework is the same,

988
00:53:05,364 --> 00:53:07,854
so whatever you work on,

989
00:53:07,878 --> 00:53:09,214
you should understand the structure well

990
00:53:09,239 --> 00:53:11,166
and apply it.

991
00:53:11,594 --> 00:53:12,988
That's all for today.

992
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:14,205
Keep up the great work.
