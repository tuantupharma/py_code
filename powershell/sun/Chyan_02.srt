2
00:00:05,984 --> 00:00:08,875
Hello, today we are going to learn about materials.

3
00:00:08,877 --> 00:00:11,832
It's good to see you again.

4
00:00:11,834 --> 00:00:13,475
This is Chyan.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,914
Are you ready for today's class?

6
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:18,265
Now, it is a bit difficult to say

7
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:19,547
that the class actually starts from today.

8
00:00:19,549 --> 00:00:22,709
Today, we'll go over analyzing materials.

9
00:00:22,734 --> 00:00:25,828
As you draw

10
00:00:25,853 --> 00:00:29,429
while you're taking the course

11
00:00:29,454 --> 00:00:32,271
you will reference a lot of materials.

12
00:00:32,296 --> 00:00:34,516
Of course, everyone has a different working style.

13
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:37,390
But, most of you will look at materials when you draw.

14
00:00:37,546 --> 00:00:39,718
So, when you look at materials,

15
00:00:39,743 --> 00:00:41,617
you can study how to utilize them.

16
00:00:41,683 --> 00:00:46,373
Drawing a lot will also help you with your studies.

17
00:00:46,398 --> 00:00:47,882
Other than actually drawing,

18
00:00:48,046 --> 00:00:50,774
when you study by analyzing with your eyes,

19
00:00:50,776 --> 00:00:52,727
you'll need to also look at materials then.

20
00:00:52,729 --> 00:00:54,477
When you do so,

21
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:56,308
you need to know how to analyze them well.

22
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,390
So, I'll go over that today.

23
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,726
Also, I will teach you

24
00:01:00,751 --> 00:01:03,835
how to adjust your drawings.

25
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,023
Of course,

26
00:01:05,048 --> 00:01:07,751
I'll go over it once more

27
00:01:07,753 --> 00:01:08,959
when I teach you about coloring.

28
00:01:08,984 --> 00:01:10,162
Still, it's good to go over it now.

29
00:01:10,187 --> 00:01:11,609
We can still utilize it later on.

30
00:01:11,812 --> 00:01:14,312
So, without further ado, let's get started.

31
00:01:16,398 --> 00:01:18,523
Before we move on,

32
00:01:18,548 --> 00:01:20,156
let's take a look at the curriculum

33
00:01:20,181 --> 00:01:22,125
of this class again.

34
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:27,039
Section 2 covers the basics.

35
00:01:27,064 --> 00:01:30,312
Section 3 will prepare you

36
00:01:30,406 --> 00:01:32,201
for your future professional works.

37
00:01:32,226 --> 00:01:35,265
Full illustration is in Section 4,

38
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,538
with portrait illustration in Section 5.

39
00:01:38,648 --> 00:01:41,004
That will be our curriculum.

40
00:01:41,006 --> 00:01:42,796
Let me show you an example.

41
00:01:45,609 --> 00:01:47,249
It's about full illustration.

42
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,828
We have some design work in Section 3.

43
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:52,906
And with that illustration,

44
00:01:53,742 --> 00:01:56,257
we are going to create a thumbnail.

45
00:01:57,796 --> 00:02:00,890
I will explain what a thumbnail sketch is later.

46
00:02:00,961 --> 00:02:03,500
After that, we will apply the base colors.

47
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:07,365
And proceed until the final touches.

48
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,144
Of course, it's not complete yet.

49
00:02:09,146 --> 00:02:10,607
It's about the middle of the process.

50
00:02:10,632 --> 00:02:12,335
But, you'll get the overall sense that

51
00:02:12,609 --> 00:02:13,709
your drawing will be completed

52
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:16,929
in this way.

53
00:02:17,973 --> 00:02:20,187
Similarly, in portrait illustration

54
00:02:22,804 --> 00:02:25,765
you design a character like this

55
00:02:26,109 --> 00:02:28,218
and with that character,

56
00:02:28,328 --> 00:02:29,820
you can create a thumbnail.

57
00:02:30,476 --> 00:02:32,656
With that thumbnail,

58
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:34,622
you set the colors

59
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,890
and complete it.

60
00:02:36,296 --> 00:02:38,467
It looks difficult.

61
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:41,710
But in this class, I'll try to explain it as easily as possible.

62
00:02:41,859 --> 00:02:44,671
So I think you can handle it.

63
00:02:44,781 --> 00:02:46,554
So, you'll go along with these processes

64
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:49,109
as I draw in this class.

65
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:53,008
In Section 3, we are going to design a character together.

66
00:02:53,523 --> 00:02:56,951
And do a full illustration in Section 4.

67
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:59,453
Also, we are going to draw a portrait illustration in Section 5.

68
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,475
I think

69
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,796
it would be more effective

70
00:03:04,821 --> 00:03:05,890
if you follow along as I draw.

71
00:03:06,093 --> 00:03:09,187
Our goal for this lecture is

72
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,060
to study about the materials

73
00:03:11,085 --> 00:03:12,585
we could use in class.

74
00:03:13,601 --> 00:03:14,865
Let's have a look, then.

75
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:15,578
There are some people

76
00:03:18,312 --> 00:03:20,758
who use photo references,

77
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,746
or drawing references.

78
00:03:22,748 --> 00:03:24,107
You'll use references for many reasons.

79
00:03:24,132 --> 00:03:25,067
It could be for drawing

80
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:27,750
or it could be for coloring.

81
00:03:28,078 --> 00:03:31,804
There are two ways for how to use references.

82
00:03:31,929 --> 00:03:44,406
First, there are the references you use to draw something beyond your skills.

83
00:03:44,431 --> 00:03:46,828
In other words, they would be references you look at as you draw.

84
00:03:47,007 --> 00:03:50,218
Second, when you aren't drawing,

85
00:03:50,312 --> 00:03:53,853
you can just search for pretty illustrations.

86
00:03:53,855 --> 00:03:56,049
But, you'll analyze why it looks pretty.

87
00:03:56,074 --> 00:03:59,007
These references are the more analytical ones.

88
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:06,109
These were the two types of references.

89
00:04:06,218 --> 00:04:08,070
The first thing we are going to learn is

90
00:04:08,095 --> 00:04:10,929
the usage of references that we use for drawing.

91
00:04:11,062 --> 00:04:14,210
I think there's a standard way to utilize them.

92
00:04:15,468 --> 00:04:17,085
That is,

93
00:04:17,195 --> 00:04:20,132
how to use them effectively

94
00:04:21,906 --> 00:04:23,882
to maximize efficiency.

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,710
That what we need to learn.

96
00:04:27,898 --> 00:04:32,565
I stress that you should know how to use them to increase efficiency

97
00:04:32,578 --> 00:04:35,303
because there is a big difference in the final work

98
00:04:35,321 --> 00:04:38,601
between knowing and not knowing how to utilize them

99
00:04:38,626 --> 00:04:42,210
when you are using references.

100
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:43,984
That's why I'm emphasizing it.

101
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,710
So, how should you use references?

102
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,217
What I want you to remember is

103
00:04:51,242 --> 00:04:52,998
the usage of references.

104
00:04:56,312 --> 00:04:57,234
For the usage of references,

105
00:04:57,492 --> 00:04:59,147
when we draw,

106
00:04:59,149 --> 00:05:01,312
some people may use a single reference,

107
00:05:01,507 --> 00:05:03,742
and some may use about 10 references.

108
00:05:03,867 --> 00:05:07,625
I've seen people using 20 to 30 references.

109
00:05:07,937 --> 00:05:10,789
But I can't tell

110
00:05:10,814 --> 00:05:13,389
which one is right.

111
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:15,685
But what I recommend to students is

112
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,414
to use about 2-3 references.

113
00:05:20,312 --> 00:05:21,843
Just one reference is fine as well.

114
00:05:21,937 --> 00:05:25,429
But maximum 2 or 3.

115
00:05:25,695 --> 00:05:26,667
Because,

116
00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:28,437
for the usage of references I mentioned before,

117
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:30,132
I'm going to explain this part in detail.

118
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:34,945
We can't get much useful information

119
00:05:35,109 --> 00:05:36,812
from one reference.

120
00:05:37,062 --> 00:05:40,187
You will be able to get more information from a reference after time passes.

121
00:05:40,212 --> 00:05:41,607
For example,

122
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:45,435
when we watch how pro gamers play,

123
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,279
and share our thoughts,

124
00:05:47,304 --> 00:05:49,911
we can only say they play well.

125
00:05:49,913 --> 00:05:52,350
But, people who also play games well

126
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:55,178
will be able to share their thoughts more.

127
00:05:55,203 --> 00:05:58,820
People who know about the game and those who don't

128
00:05:58,898 --> 00:06:00,787
get different impressions

129
00:06:00,812 --> 00:06:03,460
from the same content.

130
00:06:03,812 --> 00:06:05,910
Right now, at your level,

131
00:06:05,912 --> 00:06:09,046
you can't analyze a lot of information accurately.

132
00:06:09,071 --> 00:06:11,014
Not just yet.

133
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,084
So, when you have a lot of references

134
00:06:14,109 --> 00:06:18,617
they will be like your guardian angel.

135
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,914
That means,

136
00:06:19,931 --> 00:06:20,824
people don't get the appropriate information,

137
00:06:20,836 --> 00:06:23,109
even with the references right in front of them.

138
00:06:23,312 --> 00:06:26,197
That's why I set a limit

139
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:28,328
on the usage of references.

140
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:30,710
So the first step is

141
00:06:30,728 --> 00:06:32,960
to recognize the limits of their usage.

142
00:06:33,078 --> 00:06:35,789
So, as you reduce these steps,

143
00:06:35,814 --> 00:06:37,976
you shouldn't just put them next to you.

144
00:06:38,117 --> 00:06:40,163
What's important here

145
00:06:40,165 --> 00:06:41,406
is how you analyze things.

146
00:06:43,726 --> 00:06:45,389
Number one would be your usage of references.

147
00:06:45,391 --> 00:06:46,835
Number two would be analyzation.

148
00:06:47,304 --> 00:06:49,703
This is the most important.

149
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,312
In fact, this would be

150
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:54,209
the thing I want to emphasize the most

151
00:06:54,234 --> 00:06:56,203
in today's lecture.

152
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,209
Analyzation,

153
00:06:57,234 --> 00:07:01,139
as I said before,

154
00:07:01,141 --> 00:07:02,412
this means writing down your thoughts.

155
00:07:02,437 --> 00:07:06,803
Analyzation has a close relationship with

156
00:07:06,828 --> 00:07:08,414
the references for studying, which we are going to learn about later.

157
00:07:09,421 --> 00:07:11,253
Because when we study references,

158
00:07:11,255 --> 00:07:12,812
we do have to analyze them.

159
00:07:15,906 --> 00:07:20,191
The more thoughts you have, the better outcomes you get.

160
00:07:20,193 --> 00:07:21,937
When we have one given reference,

161
00:07:21,962 --> 00:07:24,039
some may write their thoughts in one sentence.

162
00:07:24,398 --> 00:07:25,771
On the other hand,

163
00:07:25,796 --> 00:07:28,734
some might have a lot of thoughts.

164
00:07:29,109 --> 00:07:30,355
So as I said,

165
00:07:30,357 --> 00:07:33,537
it depends on the base knowledge they have.

166
00:07:33,562 --> 00:07:36,429
That brings different outcomes.

167
00:07:36,671 --> 00:07:41,015
When someone looks at a material and writes their opinion,

168
00:07:41,664 --> 00:07:43,773
there's a huge difference between

169
00:07:43,835 --> 00:07:47,039
writing only one line and writing 10 lines.

170
00:07:47,476 --> 00:07:49,443
When we read books,

171
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:52,890
we experience a whole new world

172
00:07:52,915 --> 00:07:56,898
without actually being in it.

173
00:08:03,101 --> 00:08:05,109
Likewise, with references,

174
00:08:05,382 --> 00:08:08,026
we can experience something

175
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:10,764
that we actually can't in reality,

176
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:13,304
just like when we read books.

177
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:16,000
That is, somebody who has a single sentence of opinion,

178
00:08:16,025 --> 00:08:18,421
had that short of an experience,

179
00:08:18,609 --> 00:08:22,006
and this person's experience is worth ten times more.

180
00:08:22,008 --> 00:08:23,921
Of course, it's not real experience.

181
00:08:23,923 --> 00:08:25,373
So your drawing skills may not improve

182
00:08:25,398 --> 00:08:27,632
as much compared to hand-drawing.

183
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:30,185
Just analyzing it is worth ten times more

184
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,101
than writing one sentence of opinion.

185
00:08:33,126 --> 00:08:35,578
So that you can improve your skills more.

186
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,765
And that belongs to you.

187
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,984
So you will get to improve your drawing skills

188
00:08:41,273 --> 00:08:43,497
even when you don't draw.

189
00:08:43,695 --> 00:08:47,369
So, although it might vary personally,

190
00:08:47,371 --> 00:08:50,578
let's say there's

191
00:08:52,171 --> 00:08:54,007
an elementary school student who hasn't seen any illustrations so far

192
00:08:54,032 --> 00:08:56,304
and a junior high student who has seen a lot of illustrations.

193
00:08:56,718 --> 00:08:58,779
Actually, the elementary school student part doesn't matter.

194
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:01,148
If there's someone who has seen a lot of illustrations

195
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:04,521
and someone who hasn't, and they both

196
00:09:04,534 --> 00:09:06,902
draw an illustration for the first time in their life,

197
00:09:07,109 --> 00:09:08,396
obviously there will be different outcomes.

198
00:09:08,421 --> 00:09:09,765
This person has seen nothing

199
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,046
but this one hasn't.

200
00:09:11,071 --> 00:09:12,890
As you might guess,

201
00:09:12,915 --> 00:09:14,515
the one with more experience will get better results.

202
00:09:14,906 --> 00:09:17,045
So, although this person

203
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,312
only wrote a line of their thoughts,

204
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,703
at least they acquired something

205
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,804
while looking at references.

206
00:09:24,992 --> 00:09:28,164
So, because your goal is to study drawing,

207
00:09:28,165 --> 00:09:29,343
you should be able to

208
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:32,562
look at the drawings

209
00:09:32,587 --> 00:09:36,039
and write down 10 to 20 lines of your thoughts.

210
00:09:36,304 --> 00:09:40,289
So, let's go over how to analyze today!

211
00:09:53,148 --> 00:09:55,992
I used this image before.

212
00:09:57,804 --> 00:10:00,921
I used this one in the previous class, introducing myself.

213
00:10:02,398 --> 00:10:05,414
I will do an analysis using this image.

214
00:10:05,507 --> 00:10:09,404
I told you analyzation requires about 10 sentences.

215
00:10:09,429 --> 00:10:11,304
But if you are a newbie,

216
00:10:11,305 --> 00:10:14,171
even 3-4 sentences may be hard.

217
00:10:15,242 --> 00:10:17,125
Because you haven't tried it before.

218
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,945
So, I'll show you how to do that.

219
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,568
Then you would be able to grasp the gist

220
00:10:21,569 --> 00:10:23,726
of how to do it.

221
00:10:24,546 --> 00:10:25,570
But before we move on,

222
00:10:25,595 --> 00:10:30,078
I mentioned that we are going to learn how to edit illustrations.

223
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,593
Let's talk about editing.

224
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,350
When we draw,

225
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,041
usually, Photoshop is the standard.

226
00:10:37,043 --> 00:10:38,224
Although Photoshop is standard,

227
00:10:38,226 --> 00:10:40,421
Clip Studio Paint has similar functions.

228
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:44,273
We are going to edit a lot.

229
00:10:44,298 --> 00:10:47,681
That includes color editing, shape editing,

230
00:10:47,683 --> 00:10:48,914
etc.

231
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:52,578
I'll go over the most commonly used tools.

232
00:10:53,046 --> 00:10:55,929
I usually call them the three wonders of Photoshop.

233
00:10:58,906 --> 00:11:00,554
First, I'll go over the color edit name.

234
00:11:03,906 --> 00:11:05,367
So, without further ado,

235
00:11:05,392 --> 00:11:07,209
let's see what these three wonders are.

236
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:08,757
This one is commonly used.

237
00:11:08,906 --> 00:11:11,117
A lot of you know this.

238
00:11:11,257 --> 00:11:12,421
Ctrl+U

239
00:11:13,781 --> 00:11:15,000
It's this function.

240
00:11:15,078 --> 00:11:16,803
It's the hue saturation tool,

241
00:11:16,828 --> 00:11:22,296
from hue to saturation

242
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,312
and brightness as well.

243
00:11:24,453 --> 00:11:27,054
You can adjust them all at once with that tool.

244
00:11:28,171 --> 00:11:29,214
Once again,

245
00:11:29,216 --> 00:11:30,093
hue,

246
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:34,928
you can change the hue.

247
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,023
And saturation,

248
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:39,281
you can adjust it to be strong or weak.

249
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,695
Brightness, too.

250
00:11:41,476 --> 00:11:42,796
So, you can see that it's a very useful tool

251
00:11:43,112 --> 00:11:45,716
to adjust your illustration overall

252
00:11:45,718 --> 00:11:46,742
with a bright tone or a dark tone.

253
00:11:46,767 --> 00:11:48,967
But, there's also another way to use this.

254
00:11:48,992 --> 00:11:52,640
If you see here, you'll see the word Master.

255
00:11:52,665 --> 00:11:54,461
This refers to the overall color.

256
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:55,974
If you click this,

257
00:11:55,976 --> 00:11:57,218
you'll see other options, too.

258
00:11:58,328 --> 00:12:00,349
If you click Reds,

259
00:12:00,351 --> 00:12:02,584
you'll just adjust the red colors of the illustration.

260
00:12:02,609 --> 00:12:05,365
So, this way you could adjust

261
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,500
the saturation and the brightness of just the reds.

262
00:12:07,968 --> 00:12:09,421
That also means

263
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,117
you can apply this to other colors as well.

264
00:12:11,142 --> 00:12:15,000
You can change the blues into different colors,

265
00:12:15,218 --> 00:12:16,947
or edit many different things.

266
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:19,242
There's not many people using this function.

267
00:12:21,093 --> 00:12:24,195
With the Ctrl+U only,

268
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,515
you can apply many transformations.

269
00:12:27,718 --> 00:12:30,914
You can switch the reds like this.

270
00:12:32,312 --> 00:12:35,020
So this Ctrl+U is

271
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:36,734
pretty useful.

272
00:12:37,976 --> 00:12:44,343
The next one you can use is Ctrl+B.

273
00:12:46,578 --> 00:12:47,639
It's used to change the hue.

274
00:12:47,664 --> 00:12:49,529
It says Color Balance.

275
00:12:49,531 --> 00:12:52,086
This tool is used to adjust

276
00:12:52,088 --> 00:12:55,750
the hue part mentioned above

277
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,265
in detail.

278
00:12:57,266 --> 00:12:59,549
Of course, you could divide it into 3 parts,

279
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,015
like the dark part, bright part, and in the middle.

280
00:13:01,812 --> 00:13:04,865
So, with the Color Balance tool,

281
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:07,840
you would be able to

282
00:13:07,842 --> 00:13:09,787
adjust the hues in more detail

283
00:13:09,812 --> 00:13:11,414
compared to the Hue/Saturation tool.

284
00:13:12,171 --> 00:13:13,750
You can change it

285
00:13:13,775 --> 00:13:15,234
in detail like this.

286
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:16,840
And the third one,

287
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:21,484
would be Ctrl+M.

288
00:13:21,703 --> 00:13:24,820
This may depend on the Photoshop settings.

289
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,219
It's for Curves.

290
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,767
Some of you may adjust the Levels.

291
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,592
And there are some people using Curves.

292
00:13:32,617 --> 00:13:34,778
I prefer using Curves more.

293
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,500
Curves is used

294
00:13:36,726 --> 00:13:40,101
when you want to adjust the overall tone.

295
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:42,976
So this Tone means

296
00:13:43,001 --> 00:13:45,685
you'll literally

297
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:47,122
adjust the bright parts and the dark parts of a drawing.

298
00:13:47,123 --> 00:13:47,789
So, with Tone,

299
00:13:47,984 --> 00:13:49,281
you should check how you can

300
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,093
adjust the bright and dark parts.

301
00:13:53,906 --> 00:13:55,218
So if you take a look at this,

302
00:13:55,243 --> 00:13:57,828
on the left, there are the graphs with higher values,

303
00:13:57,915 --> 00:14:00,093
and on the right, there are graphs with lower values.

304
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,717
So this one on the left side indicates the dark part.

305
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:04,670
And the other one on the right side shows the bright part.

306
00:14:04,695 --> 00:14:07,025
This illustration is dark overall.

307
00:14:07,026 --> 00:14:09,335
So that would mean black has been applied a lot.

308
00:14:09,593 --> 00:14:12,716
If you want to make it bright,

309
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:16,187
pull this line in the middle upwards.

310
00:14:16,593 --> 00:14:18,203
Then the dark part turns bright.

311
00:14:18,906 --> 00:14:21,968
Then if you pull it down,

312
00:14:21,993 --> 00:14:23,498
the bright part will turn dark.

313
00:14:23,523 --> 00:14:25,606
So you can adjust the dark part to be brighter,

314
00:14:25,742 --> 00:14:27,154
and vice-versa.

315
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:28,764
You can adjust it like this.

316
00:14:28,789 --> 00:14:30,757
Of course, you can make the dark parts darker, and the bright parts brighter.

317
00:14:30,782 --> 00:14:32,343
Then there would be a stronger contrast.

318
00:14:34,085 --> 00:14:36,828
You'll see that this illustration became more like a neon sign.

319
00:14:37,359 --> 00:14:39,570
You can adjust the contrast like this.

320
00:14:39,595 --> 00:14:44,000
If you click the channel part on the upper side,

321
00:14:44,101 --> 00:14:47,593
you can limit the reds

322
00:14:47,618 --> 00:14:49,662
or you can add the reds overall,

323
00:14:49,687 --> 00:14:50,812
like this.

324
00:14:52,101 --> 00:14:53,599
You can add the reds into the part

325
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,117
that already have plenty of them.

326
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:58,609
Or you can add the greens

327
00:14:58,872 --> 00:15:01,601
into the part that doesn't have them much.

328
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:04,695
You can apply many different things like this.

329
00:15:04,914 --> 00:15:08,842
So these are the three wonders of Photoshop

330
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:11,670
that I commonly mention to students.

331
00:15:11,695 --> 00:15:15,084
You can adjust the colors

332
00:15:15,109 --> 00:15:17,937
with just these three things.

333
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:22,132
But, there is one more thing

334
00:15:23,867 --> 00:15:25,125
that helps you utilize them to the fullest.

335
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,600
To use these things well,

336
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:28,812
I do think you need one more thing.

337
00:15:29,002 --> 00:15:33,867
That is the Color Range tool.

338
00:15:38,289 --> 00:15:40,390
You will use them together.

339
00:15:40,695 --> 00:15:42,060
You can find this

340
00:15:42,085 --> 00:15:45,662
Color Range tool from the Select tab on the top left.

341
00:15:45,687 --> 00:15:48,373
Here's Color Range.

342
00:15:48,398 --> 00:15:51,975
If you click this, you'll see this panel.

343
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,742
The Color Range tool only picks out the parts

344
00:15:55,743 --> 00:15:57,312
that I selected with the Eyedropper tool.

345
00:15:57,492 --> 00:15:59,640
It will only show you parts

346
00:15:59,665 --> 00:16:02,313
that have the same color

347
00:16:02,314 --> 00:16:03,585
you selected with the Eyedropper.

348
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:04,690
Like this.

349
00:16:05,406 --> 00:16:07,101
When you use this tool,

350
00:16:08,976 --> 00:16:10,734
here's a tip when using Photoshop.

351
00:16:11,335 --> 00:16:13,890
Basically, the Shift key means adding something.

352
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:16,593
And the Alt key means taking something away.

353
00:16:17,585 --> 00:16:19,247
For example,

354
00:16:19,248 --> 00:16:20,781
when you apply the Select tool like this,

355
00:16:21,257 --> 00:16:22,756
holding this part selected,

356
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:25,703
press the Shift key to select more areas.

357
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:30,601
And the Alt key to take them back.

358
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:31,906
Coming back to the illustration again,

359
00:16:33,187 --> 00:16:34,531
by using this Color Range

360
00:16:34,556 --> 00:16:38,632
select the purple part of this illustration.

361
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,429
Only the purple parts are selected.

362
00:16:42,984 --> 00:16:46,092
And you can retouch

363
00:16:46,117 --> 00:16:47,710
this part only.

364
00:16:48,312 --> 00:16:52,115
With this Color Range and the "three wonders",

365
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:55,117
you can retouch most of the colors of the illustration.

366
00:16:56,289 --> 00:16:57,835
This is very important.

367
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,451
Now we've finished learning the editing tools.

368
00:17:01,476 --> 00:17:06,359
We are going to analyze the illustration on the left using an editing tool.

369
00:17:07,195 --> 00:17:10,000
And write down our thoughts.

370
00:17:10,304 --> 00:17:13,264
Here's a tip when you write down your opinions.

371
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:16,554
You may write much information about the drawing,

372
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:19,234
or maybe about the coloring.

373
00:17:19,351 --> 00:17:22,076
Then the part you focused on,

374
00:17:22,101 --> 00:17:24,931
would be your strength

375
00:17:26,632 --> 00:17:28,703
and the others would be your weakness.

376
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:33,499
Just like I said in the first lecture,

377
00:17:33,501 --> 00:17:36,203
you will find both strengths and weaknesses.

378
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:37,882
In other words,

379
00:17:38,304 --> 00:17:42,468
you can focus on your weakness.

380
00:17:44,609 --> 00:17:46,077
Or you can emphasize your strength

381
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:49,507
and strengthen your weakness.

382
00:17:49,828 --> 00:17:51,835
Now let's start analyzing.

383
00:17:53,578 --> 00:17:56,109
Looking at the illustration on the left,

384
00:17:56,134 --> 00:17:58,381
it looks calming overall

385
00:17:58,406 --> 00:18:01,210
at first sight.

386
00:18:01,296 --> 00:18:04,367
Let's analyze the reasons why

387
00:18:04,392 --> 00:18:05,546
it looks calm at first sight.

388
00:18:05,867 --> 00:18:07,804
If you have a look at the overall silhouette,

389
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:09,678
you could see the character is

390
00:18:09,703 --> 00:18:12,375
looking like this.

391
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:15,338
We will deal with this in detail later on

392
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,034
when we do the drawing part.

393
00:18:17,117 --> 00:18:20,203
You can see that most of the elements

394
00:18:20,228 --> 00:18:21,695
are placed at the bottom.

395
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:26,906
So, naturally, people would look at the bottom

396
00:18:26,931 --> 00:18:29,218
instead of looking at the top.

397
00:18:29,328 --> 00:18:30,451
So, people would concentrate on a certain point

398
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:32,921
for this drawing.

399
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:36,185
Most of the elements are focused on the bottom side.

400
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:38,804
So we are going to call this <i>triangular composition</i>.

401
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:41,390
It's arranged like this

402
00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:44,851
so it's a composition

403
00:18:44,876 --> 00:18:45,789
for which your eyes won't go all over the place.

404
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,762
This is a triangular composition.

405
00:18:51,343 --> 00:18:53,672
Do you see that the middle part here

406
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,662
is arranged so that you would focus on it more?

407
00:18:55,687 --> 00:18:58,039
So, there's a diamond composition here, too.

408
00:18:58,242 --> 00:19:01,015
We will handle this diamond composition later.

409
00:19:01,101 --> 00:19:03,843
But it helps you to make the illustration fancier.

410
00:19:03,914 --> 00:19:06,460
That means, it looks fancy

411
00:19:06,485 --> 00:19:09,218
but calming at the same time.

412
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,257
If you look at the character,

413
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:13,998
the parts that stand out

414
00:19:14,023 --> 00:19:16,417
are the skin and the hair,

415
00:19:16,418 --> 00:19:17,531
which are brighter compared to the other parts.

416
00:19:17,796 --> 00:19:20,326
If you look at the parts where the hair and skin is visible,

417
00:19:20,351 --> 00:19:23,365
you'll notice that they're focused around the center of the drawing.

418
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:27,429
But, if you look closely, there's the thigh and the hand at the bottom.

419
00:19:27,484 --> 00:19:29,869
But this part has a dark tone

420
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:31,437
compared to the skin.

421
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,896
If this part was in the same color as well,

422
00:19:34,921 --> 00:19:37,421
our gaze would have been focused here as well.

423
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,710
So, the reason why this skin part looks dark

424
00:19:40,735 --> 00:19:43,812
is because I didn't want people to look at the bottom.

425
00:19:48,703 --> 00:19:51,726
Adjusting the skin tone.

426
00:19:54,531 --> 00:19:58,562
Both blue and purple are used in the overall illustration.

427
00:19:58,563 --> 00:20:00,701
But it may look too distracting

428
00:20:00,726 --> 00:20:02,084
if you have two different types of hue

429
00:20:02,109 --> 00:20:04,185
in the drawing.

430
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,700
So let's see,

431
00:20:06,702 --> 00:20:08,500
what tricks are applied

432
00:20:08,525 --> 00:20:09,722
in this illustration.

433
00:20:09,724 --> 00:20:12,992
If you take a look at the overall colors,

434
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:16,679
you will see most of them belong to navy.

435
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:25,359
So the ratio, although they used both blue and purple,

436
00:20:25,617 --> 00:20:28,328
is not 5:5

437
00:20:28,593 --> 00:20:30,210
but it has more blue

438
00:20:30,273 --> 00:20:32,835
so it would be 7:3.

439
00:20:33,718 --> 00:20:34,434
Like this,

440
00:20:34,436 --> 00:20:36,670
when you get to use two unique colors together,

441
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:39,585
most likely you will use complementary colors

442
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:47,742
such as reds and greens,

443
00:20:49,007 --> 00:20:51,975
or yellow and navy.

444
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,789
So they are opposite to each other.

445
00:20:53,814 --> 00:20:56,480
You are going to learn the color wheel when we move on to the colors.

446
00:20:56,482 --> 00:20:58,062
And the opposite colors,

447
00:20:58,087 --> 00:20:59,906
which are totally different.

448
00:21:00,101 --> 00:21:03,234
Since those are eye catching,

449
00:21:03,492 --> 00:21:08,779
if you use them too much,

450
00:21:08,804 --> 00:21:11,031
it may be distracting from the viewer's point of view.

451
00:21:11,195 --> 00:21:13,662
So, in an illustration where your eyes could get too tired,

452
00:21:13,687 --> 00:21:15,385
one color would be the point color

453
00:21:15,387 --> 00:21:19,046
and the rest would be just the additional details.

454
00:21:19,296 --> 00:21:23,304
This way, your eyes will get less tired.

455
00:21:24,281 --> 00:21:25,851
Other than that,

456
00:21:27,664 --> 00:21:30,101
if you gray-scale the whole drawing,

457
00:21:30,126 --> 00:21:31,585
like this,

458
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:34,203
you'll see that this area became brighter.

459
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:43,007
Because of this part,

460
00:21:46,117 --> 00:21:47,764
the part that becomes slightly brighter,

461
00:21:47,789 --> 00:21:51,225
these two characters are separated.

462
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,490
And looking at the density part,

463
00:21:53,515 --> 00:21:55,170
let's move on to the high-density part.

464
00:21:55,195 --> 00:21:55,882
Density means

465
00:21:55,907 --> 00:21:58,568
a part that's clumped together.

466
00:21:58,593 --> 00:22:00,406
Let's have a look at this part with high density.

467
00:22:00,593 --> 00:22:03,521
The part with many details.

468
00:22:07,804 --> 00:22:10,203
Looking at the high-density part of the character,

469
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:12,609
there are not many details.

470
00:22:12,687 --> 00:22:14,975
It looks like it has a lot of details added to the illustration.

471
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,774
But the bottom part

472
00:22:16,775 --> 00:22:19,726
has almost no detail.

473
00:22:20,015 --> 00:22:22,296
By focusing on the details of these parts,

474
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,453
the eye-catching point I mentioned before,

475
00:22:24,478 --> 00:22:26,857
since the details are focused in the middle,

476
00:22:26,882 --> 00:22:29,617
people will be able to focus on the illustration.

477
00:22:30,312 --> 00:22:32,664
Density and concentration.

478
00:22:34,515 --> 00:22:36,085
If you look at other elements as well,

479
00:22:36,718 --> 00:22:41,195
you can see that the background used a photographic texture

480
00:22:41,296 --> 00:22:44,937
compared to the casual-style characters in the foreground.

481
00:22:45,195 --> 00:22:46,756
So, because of this,

482
00:22:46,781 --> 00:22:47,929
the background will be much more detailed

483
00:22:47,954 --> 00:22:49,210
compared to the characters in the front.

484
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:54,656
Because of it, the robot and the background,

485
00:22:54,681 --> 00:22:56,678
despite having the same colors,

486
00:22:56,703 --> 00:22:59,875
look pretty much separated.

487
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:02,109
The reason why they look separated is,

488
00:23:02,134 --> 00:23:04,234
because of this counterlight,

489
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,678
and the light from behind,

490
00:23:05,703 --> 00:23:07,796
with the light

491
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:09,968
which is high in saturation

492
00:23:09,993 --> 00:23:11,164
which helps them to be depicted separately.

493
00:23:12,617 --> 00:23:14,609
If you zoom in on the illustration,

494
00:23:15,945 --> 00:23:18,345
you may find that some noise effects

495
00:23:18,347 --> 00:23:19,117
are applied.

496
00:23:19,703 --> 00:23:20,937
Like this.

497
00:23:20,992 --> 00:23:23,013
These days, this noise effect...

498
00:23:23,014 --> 00:23:23,972
or if you have a look at this,

499
00:23:23,974 --> 00:23:24,813
you can see the pixels

500
00:23:24,815 --> 00:23:27,467
are blue and red.

501
00:23:27,492 --> 00:23:29,328
I call this the digital effect.

502
00:23:29,353 --> 00:23:32,500
We will handle this in detail later.

503
00:23:32,585 --> 00:23:36,085
With the noise and digital effect,

504
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,576
it looks a bit

505
00:23:38,601 --> 00:23:40,625
more detailed.

506
00:23:40,687 --> 00:23:41,943
So these kinds of things also contribute to

507
00:23:41,968 --> 00:23:44,031
developing the quality of the illustration.

508
00:23:44,148 --> 00:23:45,406
What were those again?

509
00:23:45,531 --> 00:23:50,937
Background, separation of the characters,

510
00:23:53,492 --> 00:23:55,881
and the counterlight do those works.

511
00:23:55,906 --> 00:23:57,109
And texture.

512
00:23:59,914 --> 00:24:01,132
With the digital effect,

513
00:24:02,351 --> 00:24:08,492
I only used it

514
00:24:08,517 --> 00:24:11,203
so that the overall quality of the illustration

515
00:24:11,228 --> 00:24:12,226
would be better.

516
00:24:12,882 --> 00:24:16,093
Sure, there is a hand stretching forwards.

517
00:24:16,804 --> 00:24:19,398
But, too much perspective isn't applied to it.

518
00:24:19,423 --> 00:24:21,873
Usually, when we see a hand

519
00:24:21,898 --> 00:24:24,482
stretched out forwards,

520
00:24:24,507 --> 00:24:25,467
they are drawn in a huge manner.

521
00:24:25,492 --> 00:24:27,193
But, if you've seen drawings where they aren't too huge,

522
00:24:27,218 --> 00:24:29,376
that's because the illustrator

523
00:24:29,378 --> 00:24:31,882
was going for

524
00:24:31,907 --> 00:24:33,524
an overall calm tone

525
00:24:33,585 --> 00:24:41,945
and didn't apply too much perspective.

526
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:45,642
Look at this part.

527
00:24:45,644 --> 00:24:46,801
Around this highlighted part,

528
00:24:46,803 --> 00:24:49,179
you can find many colors with high saturation.

529
00:24:49,304 --> 00:24:50,610
You can find that

530
00:24:50,611 --> 00:24:52,750
many colors with high saturation,

531
00:24:52,775 --> 00:24:55,210
between purple and blue, have been applied.

532
00:24:55,235 --> 00:24:58,921
Although I said plenty of them are used,

533
00:24:59,609 --> 00:25:03,304
let's minimize it and choose the part with high saturation.

534
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:06,304
Let's look at other parts with high saturation, too.

535
00:25:07,484 --> 00:25:08,982
So if you have a look at this,

536
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,545
there are some applied

537
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:13,796
in the parts we have to focus on.

538
00:25:15,304 --> 00:25:19,609
That is,

539
00:25:20,515 --> 00:25:23,459
by applying the colors with high saturation around the highlighted part,

540
00:25:23,484 --> 00:25:25,737
which is what we have to focus on, we can concentrate more easily.

541
00:25:25,882 --> 00:25:28,507
If the saturation is higher than the other parts,

542
00:25:28,687 --> 00:25:31,296
that will be eye-catching.

543
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:32,685
In the eye-catching part like this,

544
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:34,850
with the highlighter which makes it more eye-catching,

545
00:25:34,875 --> 00:25:38,921
it helps us to focus more easily.

546
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:48,695
It's the boundary color of the highlighted part.

547
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:51,609
You can use this when you match the color later on.

548
00:25:54,367 --> 00:25:55,804
Then what's next?

549
00:25:55,806 --> 00:25:59,232
So I said there's a gradation applied

550
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:02,334
between the character and the robot behind.

551
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:05,756
If you take a closer look at it, you can find glitter

552
00:26:05,781 --> 00:26:07,710
and fog effects.

553
00:26:08,289 --> 00:26:10,627
So these glitter and fog effects

554
00:26:10,629 --> 00:26:13,804
also help to signify distance.

555
00:26:14,101 --> 00:26:16,710
The fog and glitter...

556
00:26:19,601 --> 00:26:21,570
we saw in the illustration in grayscale before.

557
00:26:21,572 --> 00:26:22,972
In the grayscale illustration,

558
00:26:22,974 --> 00:26:24,401
you can see that the middle part is bright

559
00:26:24,403 --> 00:26:26,609
and the edges are dark.

560
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:30,421
It's to clean up the overall volume.

561
00:26:38,281 --> 00:26:40,345
Looking at the illustration,

562
00:26:40,347 --> 00:26:41,951
organize your thoughts like this.

563
00:26:41,976 --> 00:26:44,671
Of course, there are far more things to organize,

564
00:26:44,696 --> 00:26:46,482
besides those which already exist on my list.

565
00:26:46,507 --> 00:26:50,414
For instance, we could also analyze what a character's anatomy looks like.

566
00:26:50,585 --> 00:26:52,665
For example, this character

567
00:26:52,667 --> 00:26:54,789
has a relatively large pelvis.

568
00:26:56,492 --> 00:27:00,343
If you look at her upper body, because she is mature,

569
00:27:00,484 --> 00:27:02,775
she has a large chest, too.

570
00:27:02,777 --> 00:27:04,180
That's the reason the lower body

571
00:27:04,182 --> 00:27:06,132
gets bigger in size as well.

572
00:27:06,218 --> 00:27:09,889
As mentioned before, to make the illustration look more stable,

573
00:27:09,914 --> 00:27:12,890
I had to make sure there were a lot of elements at the bottom.

574
00:27:12,903 --> 00:27:13,572
To do that,

575
00:27:13,609 --> 00:27:16,000
I made the lower body thicker.

576
00:27:16,304 --> 00:27:20,632
We can also see that one of this character's eyes is hidden.

577
00:27:20,796 --> 00:27:22,797
There is a difference between being able to see both eyes

578
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,968
and when the viewer can only see one eye.

579
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:27,756
Because we apply more deformers to a character's eyes

580
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:30,226
compared to other body parts,

581
00:27:30,296 --> 00:27:33,224
if you can see these eyes more,

582
00:27:33,226 --> 00:27:34,990
that would mean the character tends to look more casual.

583
00:27:35,015 --> 00:27:36,262
In other words,

584
00:27:36,264 --> 00:27:38,007
the more you hide this eye,

585
00:27:38,195 --> 00:27:39,507
the more an eye is hidden,

586
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:41,842
the closer it becomes to a realistic one.

587
00:27:41,867 --> 00:27:44,734
From the viewer's perspective, this would be more realistic.

588
00:27:44,735 --> 00:27:46,178
It makes the character more mature.

589
00:27:46,203 --> 00:27:47,459
So when I worked on this illustration,

590
00:27:47,484 --> 00:27:49,812
I wanted her to be mature.

591
00:27:49,992 --> 00:27:52,726
Therefore, I didn't reveal this eye.

592
00:27:52,968 --> 00:27:56,390
You can study it by listing your thoughts.

593
00:27:56,515 --> 00:27:57,464
In this case,

594
00:27:57,466 --> 00:27:59,726
I have analyzed my illustration.

595
00:28:00,015 --> 00:28:02,365
But students have to build their own list,

596
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,984
while studying someone else's illustrations.

597
00:28:04,009 --> 00:28:05,092
In the beginning,

598
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:07,146
writing 3 to 5 sentences may be difficult.

599
00:28:07,171 --> 00:28:08,757
But if you keep working on it,

600
00:28:08,782 --> 00:28:11,656
and gradually increase the number of sentences

601
00:28:11,681 --> 00:28:13,475
to make it yours,

602
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,912
it will help to apply those

603
00:28:14,937 --> 00:28:17,310
to your illustration at the end.

604
00:28:17,335 --> 00:28:20,109
It will be a useful and valuable experience.

605
00:28:21,195 --> 00:28:25,789
Now we have to try using the editing tool.

606
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,182
When you look at references,

607
00:28:27,184 --> 00:28:29,890
there's something I want you to remember.

608
00:28:30,078 --> 00:28:32,406
Let's say this PSD file

609
00:28:32,431 --> 00:28:34,390
is not my illustration.

610
00:28:34,617 --> 00:28:35,835
Bringing in a reference,

611
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:39,117
like I did before, I checked it while using the Eyedropper tool.

612
00:28:39,281 --> 00:28:41,381
Just use it as you wish, like this.

613
00:28:41,406 --> 00:28:44,226
Because aren't selling this illustration.

614
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:46,273
It's not for commercial purposes.

615
00:28:46,617 --> 00:28:48,006
You are using it as a reference

616
00:28:48,031 --> 00:28:49,539
and for private study.

617
00:28:49,617 --> 00:28:52,601
So if you have a reference with you,

618
00:28:52,626 --> 00:28:55,564
I want you to analyze it without hesitation.

619
00:28:55,566 --> 00:28:56,718
What I mean is,

620
00:28:56,984 --> 00:28:59,039
edit this illustration as you want.

621
00:28:59,296 --> 00:29:00,710
Maximize the contrast.

622
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,289
Change the hue.

623
00:29:03,789 --> 00:29:06,709
There've been quite a lot of students who thought they are not allowed

624
00:29:06,734 --> 00:29:08,812
to edit an illustration that belongs to somebody else.

625
00:29:09,085 --> 00:29:09,929
In fact,

626
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,990
there are a lot of students who think like that.

627
00:29:13,015 --> 00:29:15,484
There are also students who never imagined such a thing.

628
00:29:16,726 --> 00:29:18,140
There will be people

629
00:29:18,165 --> 00:29:20,850
who would never have dreamed of

630
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:23,014
practicing retouching someone else's illustration.

631
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,685
But, practicing this way

632
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:28,117
would broaden your experience.

633
00:29:28,382 --> 00:29:29,904
This way,

634
00:29:29,929 --> 00:29:32,882
you can quickly be familiarized with drawing techniques.

635
00:29:33,453 --> 00:29:35,851
So, I think it's good to study while

636
00:29:37,172 --> 00:29:39,117
retouching an illustration like this.

637
00:29:39,406 --> 00:29:40,520
If it doesn't work,

638
00:29:40,522 --> 00:29:42,084
or if it's not satisfactory...

639
00:29:42,109 --> 00:29:43,879
There was this character,

640
00:29:43,904 --> 00:29:45,803
with an eye partly hidden.

641
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,617
Try to draw the other side of the eye.

642
00:29:48,117 --> 00:29:49,296
Try to draw it first.

643
00:29:50,218 --> 00:29:53,445
Or edit the drawing on your own.

644
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:55,213
If you imagine alternate situations...

645
00:29:57,195 --> 00:30:00,109
For example, if the character didn't have ears

646
00:30:00,515 --> 00:30:02,898
or if the robot was white,

647
00:30:02,923 --> 00:30:04,904
utilize the Color Balance tool

648
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:06,406
to edit your illustration.

649
00:30:08,695 --> 00:30:11,085
Select this robot

650
00:30:27,484 --> 00:30:29,703
and use the Three Wonders.

651
00:30:33,296 --> 00:30:35,740
See how the robot got really bright

652
00:30:35,765 --> 00:30:37,492
so that there's no clear distinction between its hairs?

653
00:30:39,992 --> 00:30:41,240
Also, note that because the robot is

654
00:30:41,265 --> 00:30:43,507
above the character in the foreground,

655
00:30:43,617 --> 00:30:47,210
your eyes would focus on the robot more.

656
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,304
You might think it looks like a ghost.

657
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:52,992
Let's get rid of the background.

658
00:30:52,994 --> 00:30:55,500
You can test it in many different ways.

659
00:30:57,195 --> 00:30:58,164
Applying

660
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,500
many different things

661
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:01,414
to the illustration.

662
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:03,765
Don't be afraid of it.

663
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:05,835
The main purpose of today's lecture is

664
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:08,335
to try many different things

665
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,601
without hesitation.

666
00:31:12,414 --> 00:31:15,600
Along the way, students learn how to analyze an illustration

667
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:17,000
and in that process,

668
00:31:17,025 --> 00:31:18,475
I hope students will do it without hesitation.

669
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,982
So you can get a lot of useful information

670
00:31:20,007 --> 00:31:21,998
from a single illustration,

671
00:31:22,023 --> 00:31:24,367
and make it yours.

672
00:31:24,601 --> 00:31:27,185
So far we learned how to analyze an illustration.

673
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:29,920
We learned how to analyze a material.

674
00:31:34,484 --> 00:31:36,484
In this curriculum we also need to

675
00:31:36,509 --> 00:31:38,085
design a character

676
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,896
and after the design work,

677
00:31:45,921 --> 00:31:48,146
using that, we'll do a full illustration,

678
00:31:49,903 --> 00:31:51,497
one with a background,

679
00:31:51,794 --> 00:31:52,692
and a portrait illustration.

680
00:31:54,817 --> 00:31:57,528
I mentioned that these types of illustrations are used in games.

681
00:31:57,622 --> 00:31:59,910
So we'll work on these two

682
00:31:59,935 --> 00:32:03,403
and in the process, we are going to use references.

683
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,872
So, how to use references is the goal of this lecture.

684
00:32:08,958 --> 00:32:11,503
The major use for references is

685
00:32:11,528 --> 00:32:13,574
to illustrate something that goes beyond your skills.

686
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:16,340
And there are illustrations you can use while working on something.

687
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:18,700
While others are for

688
00:32:18,725 --> 00:32:20,786
studying purposes.

689
00:32:21,192 --> 00:32:22,606
If those are used for your illustration,

690
00:32:22,631 --> 00:32:25,497
you have to keep to a limit.

691
00:32:25,606 --> 00:32:28,044
Get around 10 reference pictures

692
00:32:28,069 --> 00:32:29,566
and check again

693
00:32:29,591 --> 00:32:30,638
if your references were actually used.

694
00:32:30,663 --> 00:32:32,199
Or, if you used just one reference,

695
00:32:32,224 --> 00:32:34,927
check if you analyzed it like I did

696
00:32:34,974 --> 00:32:37,911
or if you just put it to one side.

697
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:42,622
These differences will be significant in the end.

698
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:46,177
So, think once more about this.

699
00:32:46,202 --> 00:32:48,777
You should realize

700
00:32:48,802 --> 00:32:50,675
how much you can analyze an illustration.

701
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,472
In the beginning,

702
00:32:53,497 --> 00:32:54,492
I recommend just 2-3 illustrations.

703
00:32:54,494 --> 00:32:55,939
That would be enough.

704
00:32:55,941 --> 00:32:58,099
Because when you refer to these illustrations,

705
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,708
you are only going to see the gorgeous ones.

706
00:32:59,833 --> 00:33:02,146
So with 2-3 gorgeous illustrations,

707
00:33:02,294 --> 00:33:05,435
you will get an outcome that goes far beyond your skills.

708
00:33:05,903 --> 00:33:07,724
And when you have a look at the references,

709
00:33:07,749 --> 00:33:10,528
the most important thing is to analyze them precisely.

710
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:11,871
When you are analyzing,

711
00:33:11,896 --> 00:33:15,584
use the editing tools.

712
00:33:15,586 --> 00:33:18,035
And try to organize your thoughts

713
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,692
as much as possible.

714
00:33:20,786 --> 00:33:22,113
Through that process,

715
00:33:22,138 --> 00:33:23,730
maximize the information

716
00:33:23,732 --> 00:33:25,192
you can get from one illustration.

717
00:33:25,217 --> 00:33:27,216
By repeating this routine,

718
00:33:27,794 --> 00:33:29,935
you will be able to improve your skills,

719
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:33,310
even when you don't draw.

720
00:33:34,825 --> 00:33:38,474
Let's utilize the reference today.

721
00:33:38,911 --> 00:33:40,771
I'll apply what I went over in today's class

722
00:33:40,796 --> 00:33:41,802
to show you

723
00:33:43,083 --> 00:33:44,974
how to use references to draw.

724
00:33:45,396 --> 00:33:47,739
The first method was

725
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:50,075
how to use references

726
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,798
to create illustrations that go beyond your skills

727
00:33:51,981 --> 00:33:55,513
and to change your current illustrations.

728
00:33:55,538 --> 00:33:59,206
At first, this was an illustration with a lot of purples and blues.

729
00:33:59,231 --> 00:34:01,856
But, overall, it had more blue hues.

730
00:34:01,881 --> 00:34:06,872
The illustration also had small areas of purple with high saturation.

731
00:34:07,044 --> 00:34:09,200
So, let's compare.

732
00:34:12,251 --> 00:34:13,950
First of all,

733
00:34:20,192 --> 00:34:21,277
here's a tip.

734
00:34:21,302 --> 00:34:22,785
When you use the Color Range tool,

735
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:26,810
there's the Fuzziness menu, and when you set it high,

736
00:34:26,903 --> 00:34:29,606
even similar colors will be selected.

737
00:34:30,185 --> 00:34:32,200
But, on the other hand, if you set it low,

738
00:34:32,225 --> 00:34:35,544
only the colors that you chose will be selected.

739
00:34:36,106 --> 00:34:39,630
So, for now, I'll only select the white area in the background.

740
00:34:40,177 --> 00:34:41,516
I'll select it.

741
00:34:42,204 --> 00:34:43,734
And I will lower the brightness.

742
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:49,419
The blues and the indigos are used the most overall.

743
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:52,294
And the background has that kind of vibe.

744
00:34:57,247 --> 00:35:00,413
Let's put in some whites

745
00:35:00,415 --> 00:35:04,114
to show there's a color gradation around the character.

746
00:35:06,591 --> 00:35:09,802
The character was dark overall.

747
00:35:09,911 --> 00:35:13,339
Therefore, create a layer,

748
00:35:13,364 --> 00:35:14,622
and use the Clipping Mask function.

749
00:35:14,747 --> 00:35:17,199
Pressing the Alt key,

750
00:35:17,224 --> 00:35:22,599
you can click the middle of the layers to make it quick.

751
00:35:23,395 --> 00:35:26,666
Or if you right click,

752
00:35:26,668 --> 00:35:28,333
the Setting pops up.

753
00:35:30,435 --> 00:35:32,895
If you use the Clipping Mask function like this,

754
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:35,403
Whatever I do on the upper side,

755
00:35:35,685 --> 00:35:38,708
it won't go over the layer on the bottom.

756
00:35:39,614 --> 00:35:44,901
So make it dark like this.

757
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,286
I said it has an indigo tone overall before.

758
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:51,708
So we have to reflect that as well.

759
00:35:52,177 --> 00:35:54,075
Add some blue colors

760
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:59,036
to this dark part.

761
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:04,804
And this color on the bottom,

762
00:36:04,806 --> 00:36:07,505
needs more blue color.

763
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:10,020
I used the Color Balance tool.

764
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,942
I said the benefit of it is the detailed color transformation.

765
00:36:26,692 --> 00:36:29,800
So we have to give it a counterlight as well.

766
00:36:29,825 --> 00:36:31,419
Create a layer again.

767
00:36:31,513 --> 00:36:33,817
Press the Alt key to use the Clipping Mask function.

768
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:52,173
And repeat what you learned

769
00:36:52,198 --> 00:36:53,907
from the lecture like this.

770
00:37:06,285 --> 00:37:09,605
Let's increase the blues overall.

771
00:37:17,285 --> 00:37:19,504
Also, this Clipping Mask function we learned today,

772
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:21,776
if you want to use it on the same layer,

773
00:37:21,801 --> 00:37:24,074
there's a lock button up here.

774
00:37:24,504 --> 00:37:26,684
There are a lot of ways to lock a layer.

775
00:37:26,709 --> 00:37:28,910
If you click the one on the far left

776
00:37:29,402 --> 00:37:30,340
right here,

777
00:37:30,365 --> 00:37:32,324
just like the Clipping Mask before,

778
00:37:34,082 --> 00:37:38,434
I won't be able to color beyond the area I've selected.

779
00:37:40,996 --> 00:37:45,190
By using this,

780
00:37:45,215 --> 00:37:47,012
let's add more blues around the character little by little.

781
00:37:47,707 --> 00:37:49,441
And do you remember other things we learned today?

782
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:51,355
Among the things we analyzed on the left,

783
00:37:51,357 --> 00:37:53,207
There was information about the highlights.

784
00:37:57,848 --> 00:38:03,324
I said that the highlight is applied in a small area

785
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:06,699
and add a high-solid color.

786
00:38:07,769 --> 00:38:09,346
So I called it a tertiary color.

787
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:12,582
We will handle this tertiary color in detail

788
00:38:12,607 --> 00:38:14,820
when we learn about the coloring.

789
00:38:15,309 --> 00:38:17,707
So it means it's important.

790
00:38:19,099 --> 00:38:21,910
Those who need to learn it beforehand, please remember it.

791
00:38:23,113 --> 00:38:25,012
I'll add in some highlights.

792
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,714
So here, only the small area in the middle is bright

793
00:38:29,732 --> 00:38:31,215
but this illustration is bright overall.

794
00:38:31,832 --> 00:38:32,948
And the lower body part,

795
00:38:32,973 --> 00:38:34,988
it'd be good to give it some dark colors.

796
00:38:39,605 --> 00:38:43,326
The background part was a bit dense

797
00:38:43,328 --> 00:38:45,199
and the character part was simple.

798
00:38:47,019 --> 00:38:49,105
So it's easy to separate them.

799
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:52,199
Then it'd be nice if there was something squishy in the background.

800
00:39:05,666 --> 00:39:07,294
I'll use the Lasso tool

801
00:39:07,911 --> 00:39:09,427
to randomly select things

802
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:12,928
and make randomly-shaped objects.

803
00:39:15,896 --> 00:39:19,427
Right now, my goal isn't to complete this illustration.

804
00:39:19,802 --> 00:39:23,341
I'll just utilize what we've learned from the previous illustration.

805
00:39:26,294 --> 00:39:29,950
I'll mimic the purple parts in the background

806
00:39:34,223 --> 00:39:36,192
and draw a moon in the background as well.

807
00:39:54,989 --> 00:39:56,855
And don't forget

808
00:39:56,857 --> 00:39:58,716
the gradation around the character.

809
00:39:59,107 --> 00:40:01,388
So you can separate the character from a background.

810
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:51,294
The colors are retouched a bit more.

811
00:40:51,319 --> 00:40:53,811
These two images are like a before and after image.

812
00:40:53,836 --> 00:40:56,639
So, you'd be able to edit an illustration quickly.

813
00:40:56,881 --> 00:40:59,819
The reference image is the one on the left

814
00:40:59,844 --> 00:41:05,709
and in this example, I drew the image on the right.

815
00:41:06,303 --> 00:41:09,677
Today, we learned how to use materials.

816
00:41:09,702 --> 00:41:10,670
From the next class,

817
00:41:10,672 --> 00:41:13,022
we're going to have more professional classes.

818
00:41:13,108 --> 00:41:15,733
To make it easy,

819
00:41:15,803 --> 00:41:17,498
when you actually start drawing,

820
00:41:17,584 --> 00:41:21,458
you will need to know how to use references.

821
00:41:21,483 --> 00:41:23,733
Some people believe that searching for references

822
00:41:23,758 --> 00:41:26,903
also belongs to the artist's skillset.

823
00:41:26,928 --> 00:41:28,559
When we analyze references,

824
00:41:28,584 --> 00:41:30,294
you can't rate your illustration

825
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:32,623
from somebody else's point of view.

826
00:41:32,803 --> 00:41:35,606
Your illustration may look good right now,

827
00:41:35,631 --> 00:41:38,114
but it might not satisfy you a month later.

828
00:41:38,139 --> 00:41:39,897
It happens when it's your illustration.

829
00:41:39,983 --> 00:41:43,583
So it would be better

830
00:41:43,608 --> 00:41:46,981
to analyze others' illustrations,

831
00:41:47,006 --> 00:41:49,397
which you can rate more objectively.

832
00:41:49,422 --> 00:41:50,988
Through that experience,

833
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:52,358
you will be able to develop your skills.

834
00:41:52,383 --> 00:41:54,786
If you continue that experience,

835
00:41:54,811 --> 00:41:55,864
I believe that

836
00:41:55,889 --> 00:41:58,389
you will reach the next level one day.

837
00:41:58,686 --> 00:42:01,600
So I hope you don't stop working on it.

838
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:05,129
It's the end of the class now.

839
00:42:05,154 --> 00:42:07,875
See you soon

840
00:42:08,398 --> 00:42:09,721
in the next class.
